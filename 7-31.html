today was the OPI day! i ended up not studying at all last night because i was uhmmmmmm scrolling and making 선생님 her
gift box out of paper (infinity box). so i decided i was gonna wake up at 6 to study, then comes morning and 이모 is 
calling us up, and i realized i fell asleep reading manga....so no alarms were set nor did i charge my phone...oops
anyways today we ate with kim again, which was less awkward than usual, he even complimented my outfit today. it think
he's really warming up to us, which is ironic cause we only have 2 more nights in his house...maybe thats why hes so 
cheery LOL
</p>

<p>
after breakfast, we headed out, but i realized i forgot my gift, so i had to go all the way up to get it, and we were a 
lil later than usual but it was chill. we got there and i started writing my 지기 소개, trying to use as much grammar 
as possible. it was kinda funny because it asked us to introduce our parents and their jobs, but it was an obvious
grab to force us to use 높임말 lol, cause no ones every doing that in a real life self intro. i got thru it, and we went
to class super jittery and nervous; apprently no one really studied this time....oof (except mika ofc lol). we all left
the classroom, bc thats where the OPI was. all the other classes and ppl not donig the OPI gathered in the room at the 
end of the hallway. me and kaila were just practicing together the whole time; we went thru the 소개, did the 5 topics,
then went through thr role play. bc jordan was first and late again (literally late everyday of this week ugh) we all
moved up a spot (i was og 3rd from bottom so chillen). 선생님 also was powering thru ppl, so the time to practice was 
much shorter than expected.
</p>

<p>
i was pacing outside really nervously, until she finally called me in. i sat down really nervous, but she kept reassuring
me that it was fine. the first thing she did when i walked in was give me a up and down. she then told me that izzy 
introduced me as her friend during the OPI, and said I was weraing a blue shirt and black pants; 선생님 wrote it down
on the whiteboard to fact check, and told me i had to have a chat with izzy about lying about my clothes LOL i love her
it was such a perfect way to lighten the mood by joking about. she knows me too well.....i did then my 소개 i yapped 
about hiking and hating cicadas, and she gave me commentary in between so it felt a lot like an actual convo which was 
nice. after yapping about hiking, she thought i was done, but NO i busted out with me liking origami LOL, she looked 
like she was waiting for me to finish LOL I also tried to use the most grammar possible and yap as much as possible so
that i wouldnt have ot do as muhc more the other topics. after that, 선생님 complimented me so much, she said that if 
there was a speech when recieving the award at the saturday ceremony she'd want me to do it, that i was the best speaker
in the class cause i was so calm, and that sophia (mistakes a lot but very confident) and mika were very close and super
good. it was such a huge compliment, and i totally didn't expect that at all. it feels reassuring to know that my korean
isnt absolute shit and that ive actually been improving, especially in speaking. after that we yapped together about 
the balloons we're gonna blow up together, then we just did a role play (i dont think i even did another topic...unless
we did and im just hallucinating) about 동아리, being the nice person she is, we did a 등산동아리, and i was able to ask
most of the questions on the sheet + more about meeting place, and how difficult the hikes were. my grammar was very 
simple and even a bit nonexistent at this point, but she just finished it and said i did well??? it felt so good hehe
</p>

<p>
i went out and kaila and yannie were waiting outside, and said we were laughing so much! it felt so good to be done and 
just reassuring other people that they'll be fine. i went back to the classroom and went to 편의점 with ivy, izzie, and 
larry to get snacks + snacks for 선생님 (strawberry cookies hehe) and went back to write a little note (also drew 박보금)
and folded it into a crane for her to put into the box, and she'd unfold to read the message. mika went to go buy flowers
and we each contributed 1500 won, which was ok. when everyone finished, we went back to the main classroom, blew up 
balloons, and played bingo to see who could choose the person whos walking on stage to recieve certificates. ivy won,
and many people were between me and kunkel going...kunkel was weirdly endorsive, and i ended up being chosen and given a 
crown...i was called 여황하고 왕비 for the rest of the classtime LOL, it was funny to see so much support. we also 
gave 선생님 the gifts then, and took SOO MANY PHOTOS, reality was finally hitting that that was our last freaking class,
and last day seeing 선생님, whihc was so freaking sad. im glad we also got one of our table group cause we were pretty OP
:))) mika and i took a video of the finger bending thing: a 1 and a 3 for the 31st of july lol. after that, we went out 
to the fancy automotive engineering building for the ceremony, where we recieved our certificates for completing the 
program, and some people went up to speak. kunkel talked about his appreciation for 선생님 being a reliable and kind 
person, and how great our table group was which was actually really sweet. some people started tearing up which was sad.
also, the 2A class teacher forgot to hand jennifer her certificate which was sad. after that, we took a group photo,
</p>

<p>
and got lunch. there was a subway sandwhich, and a whole box with chicken, fruit, and tofu skin rice pockets, which were
freaking delicious, the sandwich not so much (too sweet). nsliy also bought us all gongcha, which was very yummy. we
got to eat with 선생님 which was really good to chat with her. apparently shes married and we just found out?? LOL after
lunch, we all just left! no tutoring haha, im glad
</p>

<p>
we took pics at the hangyang lion and plaza as a last memory, and also went to the bookstore, but i didnt end up buying
another textbook, tho i did get a thing tip marker for 1400 won. then i went to 상왕십리 아름다운가게 to cop the kangol
backpack for 11k, which im super grateful for. the clerks were again 2 really cute guys, lol, at first i thought they
were the same guys as yesterday...i can sense a marketing strategy lol. then i went to 성수 to meet laryssa, ivy, and 
izzie at the ate popup, but apparently that one was reservation only too, which sucked. so they went to fwee to get 
makeup. i literally cannot follow a map apprently bc i got lost on the way there, stopped by a CU to cool down and 
destress, then found my way again, and realized the maps looked different bc i was referencing both naver and kakao lol.
(i still dont have data goddamnit, that night ill switch card with sophie, and its the phones problem sophie still had 
data with my card). we got there and it was so small and packed. laryssa, ivy, and izzie all got matching tints, and 
i wasnt gonna get anything until they told me that this purple shade called feelin really suited me, and it was really
pretty! it was 16500, but since im trying to spend the rest of my cash, i went for it, and im pretty satisfied. i also
had to learn how to use the makeup remover bottles, apparently you just push down LOL. we also all got a free keychain
which some of a tint with any purchase, so i got a tiny keychain in blue and its so cute! after that, bc the rest of 
them had to go pack, we split ways. BUT not until we did a photobooth together (long overdue) we did a 0.5 green room and
the photos turned out really cute. we all really liked our glasses and wanted to get the same style (hopefully cheap 
somewhere) then i went to go find a stationary store Point of View, but it was so packed that there was a wait, so i just
kept walking until i hit a CU, and got a really refreshing grape sparkling water + a toothbrush, and just sat and 
decompressed and cooled down. then i decided to go to wangshimri to finish gift shopping (ironic bc i just came from
that direction lol), and i was ironically closer to 뚝썸역 than 성수역, makes u realize how close they actually are lol.
i also passed by the chaeun woo cut out and the bbq restaurant we went to together once lol, was funny. i went and got 
a bunch of snacks, keycahins, and gift bags, was fun and pretty cheap, only 16500 won around. 
</p>

<p>
then i went home, and imo, sophie, and kim came home not soon after, and we were eating immediately, and i had a bunch
of repacking and organizing to do, esp cause i wanted to take the new backpack to andong. we ate, and kim was really
concerned about sophie and kept asking about her, which was so sweet. shes still taking all sorts of medicine LOL. then 
we went to go sort the trash, and ran into 쿠로엄마 for the last time, which was sad. we hugged and said by. also the 
last trash sorting together....sad.....especially since kim wont help her; she always says its so 힘들어....sucks
</p>

<p>
then we went home and ate ice cream again (not 이모 cause she has a gastronoscopy tomorrow). then i went to go shower.
everything was as usual, until i was going in, accidentlly slipped a little, and tapped by hand on the shower caddy.
then started showering. then my hand started to sting, ad i realized i had a huge gash from 이모's razor. it hurt, but
at this point i was butt ass naked, and wet, so i couldnt just go out to get medicine....so i obviously i just showered
with blood running down my hand, came out, dried with one hand and wrapped other hand it a bunhc of toilet paper, then
had to go wake up 이모 to help me. as she was waking up, she frantically clipped something onto her head, which i think
was probably a wig, or at least a toupee lol, super unexpected but it makes sense haha. anyways she was super panicked,
and even kim came to check on me, grabbed my hand, looked at it in the light, and then left LOL. 이모 gave me liquid 
medicine (baby?) powers to coagulate the blood, and 2 bandaids to put over it. she then came a while later and gave me
2 pills to eat to prevent inflmataion, which is apparently really bad in the summer, it was so overkill it was funny lol
se also gave me the liquid medicine and a bunhc of old bandaids to take with me to andong, so freaking sweet. she was 
also so disturbed by me cutting my hand that she threw her razor away lol oof. 
</p>

<p>
it was quite the day (and night), so bittersweet yet great in the moment. ill really really really miss everyone for
all that theyve done for me, both actively and just passively being there and improving the overall environment and vibe,
especially the table group and kunkel. so grateful i was able to find so a weird and amazing group of friends in ivy,
izzie, larry, and salene- im incredibly happy to know that ill still have that support system for a while (we're already
making plans to meet up LOL)....but ill miss them so freaking much. but no more sad stuff....we still have 4 days! 
회팅!! :')
