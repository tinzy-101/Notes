<ul>
<li>
Pass a pointer in by reference when the memory location that the pointer points to needs to be changes 

<ul>
<li>
double*&amp; p

<li>
passing in by value won't modify the pointer in main()

</ul>
</ul>
<div id="Bag Class with Dynamic Array"><h3 id="Bag Class with Dynamic Array" class="header"><a href="#Bag Class with Dynamic Array">Bag Class with Dynamic Array</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
for array, index from 1st element (0) to the last element + 1 (e.g. size 5, 5+1=6)

<li>
copy constructor: pass in const ref object (to another bag) 

<ul>
<li>
if you write bag b = a, and you don't have a copy constructor, both b and a will be pointing to the same array

<li>
huge problem! need to create a new bag, and only copy constructor will do that 

<li>
if class has pointer data member, MUST overload assignment operator, write destructor, and copy constructor

<ul>
<li>
in our bag sequence, the data[] array is a pointer!

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
passing in arguments as const ref is efficient 

<ul>
<li>
dont need to call copy onstructor  OR destructor 

</ul>
<li>
call destructor when function returns 

<li>
overloaded = needs to ignore statements like a = a 

<ul>
<li>
if(this == &amp;source)

<li>
		return

</ul>
<li>
when returning a new bag object, need to call copy constructor for temp variable

</ol>
