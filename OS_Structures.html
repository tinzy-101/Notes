<span id="2.1 Operating-sytem services-Introduction"></span><strong id="Introduction">Introduction</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; need goals of OS to be well defined b4 designing OS
	--&gt; lots of angles to look at OS:
		--&gt; services it provides
		--&gt; interface 
		--&gt; components and connectons
</pre>
<p>
<span id="2.1 Operating-sytem services-OS services"></span><strong id="OS services">OS services</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; OS lets you execute programs 
	
	classes:
	1. user + other system programs
	2. gui + touchscreen + command line
	3. user inferfaces
	4. system calls
	5. program execution + i/o ops + file sys + comm + resource allocation + accounting
	6. error detection + protection and security (services)
	7. OS
	8. hardware 
	
	--&gt; main services that OS provides to user
		1. user inferface
			--&gt; can be GUI, touch screen, or command line
		2. program execution
			--&gt; OS can load program into mem and run it/end it
		3. I/O operations
			--&gt; running program might need i/o, and user cant touch i/o directly
		4. file system manipulation
		5. communications
			--&gt; processes need to talk to each other using shared mem (both processed write to same section of mem)
		6. error detection and correction
	
	--&gt; main services that OS provides to system
		1. resource allocation: use CPU scheduling, look at CPU speed, process to execute number of processing cores on CPU
		2. logging: keep track of who uses how much fo resources
		3. protection and security: dont let processes interfere with eachother 
</pre>

<p>
<span id="2.2 User and operating-system interface-Command interpreters"></span><strong id="Command interpreters">Command interpreters</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; most OS use cmd as program to run when process intiated or when user logs in
		--&gt; if sys has multiple cmds to choose from, interpreters called shells
		--&gt; use cmd to get and execute next user command (create/delete files eg.)
		--&gt; UNIX/linux OS's cmd do not understand commands
			--&gt; they search for command in a file and execute the file
			--&gt; e.g. "rm file" --&gt; cmd searches for file "rm" and executes with param "file"
</pre>
<p>
<span id="2.2 User and operating-system interface-GUI"></span><strong id="GUI">GUI</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; more user friendly, mouse based, uses a desktop 
	--&gt; traditionally, UNIX systems no GUI
		--&gt; now GUI like K Desktop Environment (KDE) and GNOME (from GNU) available 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="2.2 User and operating-system interface-Choice of Interface"></span><strong id="Choice of Interface">Choice of Interface</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; sysadmins and power users use cmd bc it is more efficient
	--&gt; GUI isn't as powerful as cmd
	--&gt; cmd makes things less repetitive (shell scripts) 
</pre>

<div id="2.3 System Calls"><h3 id="2.3 System Calls" class="header"><a href="#2.3 System Calls">2.3 System Calls</a></h3></div>
<p>
<span id="2.3 System Calls-App programming interface"></span><strong id="App programming interface">App programming interface</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; system call = interface to services that OS makes available 
		--&gt; systems execute 1000s of syscalls per sec, but users never see this
		--&gt; every OS can own name for each syscall
	--&gt; APIs = define set of functions available to appdev
		--&gt; includes params passed to each function + return values
		--&gt; e.g. windows API, POSIX API (includes all UNIX/Linux/macos), and Java API (for apps on java vm)
		--&gt; programmer accesses thru code library on OS (e.g. libc for unix and linux)
		--&gt; typical format ssize_t read(int fd, voicd *buf, size_t count) --&gt; return value, function name (read), and params
	--&gt; using APIs vs invoking system calls
		--&gt; makes program more portable + easier to work with than syscalls 
		--&gt; need the run-time environment (RTE) for syscalls 
		--&gt; in API, user only needs to know what OS will do when syscall executed 
	--&gt; syscalls different dependin on computer, usually need parameters
		--&gt; easiest is to pass paams in registers	
			--&gt; if more params than registers, pass in table of memory 
			--&gt; &lt;= 5 param [[use]] register, if not use tables 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="2.3 System Calls-Types of system calls"></span><strong id="Types of system calls">Types of system calls</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	1. process control
		--&gt; program needs to stop thru a syscall (or if error in program), this will invoke a mem dump that a debugger will read 
		--&gt; one process can call another programs as long as OS saves mem of og program 
		--&gt; need to be able to create processes and control execution:
			--&gt; stop process after amt of time or after event/signal
			--&gt; if 2+ processes share data, use "lock" so that no other process can use data until lock released
	2. File management
		--&gt; need to create delete, name, create attributes for files
		--&gt; need to open, read, write, reposition, close files 
		--&gt; some OSes have system calls for these operations, others have API to perform the operations, others uses sytem programs
	3. Device management
		--&gt; if process needs multiple resources, OS has to figure out how to allocate them
		--&gt; devices = all resources controlled by OS (physical and virtual) 
		--&gt; need to request then release a device (like open and close for files) 
			--&gt; can read, write and maybe reposition device once requested 
		--&gt; many OSes have file-device system with system calls for files AND devices 
	4. Information maintenance 
			--&gt; many syscalls only for transferring info b/w user and OS (e.g. time and date)
			--&gt; also syscalls when debugging program
				--&gt; can dump memory 
			--&gt; many OSes have time profile to show how long program executes and where 
	5. Communication
		a. message passing model
			--&gt; communicating processes exchange messages to transfer info,indirectly or directly
			--&gt; need connection open + host name + process name to start sending messages
			--&gt; most processes that recieve connections = daemons sys programs provided for the purpose)
			--&gt; client = source, server = recieveing daemon 
			--&gt; need to close connection at the end
			--&gt; good for less data, and less risky
		b. shared memory model
			--&gt; processes create and share mem owned by other processes 
			--&gt; both processes need to agree to share mem 
			--&gt; write data in shared area to communicate (not controlled by OS) 
			--&gt; quicker, but might be issues with syncrhonization
	6. Protection
		--&gt; control access to resources
		--&gt; need to set and get permission for files and disks
		--&gt; determine which users can/cannot access certain resources

<pre>
	--&gt; file management/mod, status info, support programming languages, load/execute programs, communication b/w processes and users, app programs 
	--&gt; background services = some sysprograms run at boot time and run til finish or comp stops
	--&gt; most users see only application and system programs, not actual syscalls 
</pre>

<div id="2.5 Linkers and loaders"><h3 id="2.5 Linkers and loaders" class="header"><a href="#2.5 Linkers and loaders">2.5 Linkers and loaders</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	--&gt; programs live on disk as binary executable file (a.out or prog.exe) 
		--&gt; if want to run on CPU, need to bring it into mem and placed in context of process
		
	Role of linker and loader
	1. source program: main.c
	2. compiler reads source program: gcc -c main.c
	3. output is object (compiled) code, which is processed by the linker
		--&gt; the linker find and merges other object files needed to execute program
	4. output is an executable file
	5. at run time, when program invoked,loader loads program into memory
		--&gt; also loads other code like dynamiccaly linked libraries
	6. ./main = process, which can now execute 
		
	--&gt; linker = system service that combines relocatable files into a single binary executable
	--&gt; loader = system service that loads file from linker into mem, where it can run on CPU core
	--&gt; executable and linable format (ELF) = UNIX standard format for relocatable and executable files
	--&gt; relocatable file = output of a compiler, contents can be loaded to anywhere in physical memory

<div id="2.6 Why apps are OS-specific"><h3 id="2.6 Why apps are OS-specific" class="header"><a href="#2.6 Why apps are OS-specific">2.6 Why apps are OS-specific</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	--&gt; apps compiled on one OS not necessarily executable on another OS
		--&gt; bc every OS has differen system calls 
	--&gt; yet, many apps run across multiple OSes
		1. app written in interpretted lang (python) that can be interpreted on many OSes
			--&gt; call native OS system calls afer reading each line of program
			--&gt; worse performance compared to native apps bc interpreter only has some syscalls
		2. app written in lang w/ virtual machine that runs app
			--&gt; e.g. java VM , java has run time environment to load java app into java VM
			--&gt; RTE (run time envi) is ported for lots of OSes, app will work wherever RTE does
		3. standard API/languge where compiler gens bins in machine/OS specific language
			--&gt; app has to be ported onto each OS, basically need new version for each OS
	--&gt; Challenges with porting apps across OSes
		1. every OS has binary format for apps
			--&gt; determines header, instructions, and variable layouts 
		2. CPUs have differnt levels of instruction sets that apps need to comply with
		3. OSes have different system calls (operands and operand orderings)
	--&gt; addressing challenges:
		--&gt; linux and unix adopt ELF format for binary executables, not tied to computer arch
		--&gt; application binary interface defines how diff components of binary code can interface for OS on specific architecture
			--&gt; specified for specific arch
			--&gt; arch level equivalent to API

</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; highest level reqs = hardware + type of ystem (desktop/laptop, mobile, distributed, real time)
	--&gt; 2nd highest level = user goals + system goals
		--&gt; user wants easy to use/earn, reliable, safe, fast, system
		--&gt; devs want system easy to design, create, maintain, operate, felixble, reliable, safe
		--&gt; no one way to do it

<p>
<span id="2.7 OS design and implementation-Mechanisms and policies"></span><strong id="Mechanisms and policies">Mechanisms and policies</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; policy vs mechanism
		--&gt; mechanism = how to do something
		--&gt; policy = what will be done 
	--&gt; need to be flexible 
	--&gt; microkernel OSes separate mech and policy by creating primitive building blocks
		--&gt; blocks have no policy, so can have more mechanisms and policies to be added by users/user programs 
	--&gt; policy decisions important for resource allocation 
		--&gt; make policy decision when deciding whether or no to use resource
		--&gt; determine mechanism when asking "how"
</pre>
<p>
<span id="2.7 OS design and implementation-Implementation"></span><strong id="Implementation">Implementation</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; early OS in assembly, now mostly in C/C++ with some assembly 
		--&gt; e.g. android kernel written in C + some assembly, libraries in c/c++
	--&gt; use high level langs bc quicker, compact, easier to understand, easy to port 
	--&gt; disadvantages of high level lang: slower + more storage reqs 
		--&gt; making use of computer's brain w/ high level, better than human brain writing assembly
			--&gt; improve OS thru better data structures/algos
			--&gt; don't improve thru better assembly 
	--&gt; most important part of OS = interrupt handlers, I/O manager, mem manager, CPU scheduler
		--&gt; once these work, worry about other bottlenecks later

<div id="2.8 OS Structure"><h3 id="2.8 OS Structure" class="header"><a href="#2.8 OS Structure">2.8 OS Structure</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	--&gt; basic OS structure = partition into small modules, don't have 1 single system
	--&gt; analogy: when programmed, not everything in main function, split into outside funcs
</pre>
<p>
<span id="2.8 OS Structure-Monolithic structure"></span><strong id="Monolithic structure">Monolithic structure</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; simplest = no structure, entire kernel = single static binary file in 1 address
	--&gt; e.g. og UNIX with only 2 separable parts
		--&gt; kernel (interfaces + devdrives) + systems programs 
		--&gt; kernel gives file system, CPU scheduling, mem management thru syscalls
		--&gt; above kernel = shells, compilers interpreters, sys libraries and users
		--&gt; below kernel = terminal controllers, terminals, devControllers, memControllers, phys mem
	--&gt; linux has similar structure 
		--&gt; apps use glibc to communicate with kernel thru syscall interface 
		--&gt; runs entirely in kernel mode in single address space
		--&gt; modular design so can be modified during run time 
	--&gt; con: hard to implement and extend
	--&gt; pro: little overhead in syscall interface, quick comm in kernel, efficient
</pre>
<p>
<span id="2.8 OS Structure-Layered approach"></span><strong id="Layered approach">Layered approach</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; tighly coupled vs loosely
		--&gt; monolithic: tightly coupled, one small change changes everything
		--&gt; layered: loosely coupled, sys divided into separate components w/ specific and limited function
	--&gt; OS id broken into levels (0 = hardware, highest N = UI)
	--&gt; each higher layer can invoke operations on the lower layer 
		--&gt; every higher layer implemented only with operations from lower layers 
		--&gt; each layer abstracts data structures, operations, and hardware from higher ones
	--&gt; can debug layer by layer starting on highest 
	--&gt; use in:
		--&gt; computer networks and web apps
		--&gt; not many OSes use it bc hard to define functionality in each layer 
			--&gt; poor performance bc user has to go thru each layer to get an OS service
			--&gt; most OSes just have some layering
</pre>
<p>
<span id="2.8 OS Structure-Microkernels"></span><strong id="Microkernels">Microkernels</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; remove all nonessential components of kernel, and implemen then in user programs in separate address spaces
	--&gt; microkernels dont do much process and mem management
	--&gt; main functions:
		--&gt; comm b/w client program and other services in user space (message passin)
		--&gt; extend OS easier, don't need to change kernel when changing user space
		--&gt; easier to port to other OSes 
		--&gt; more secure ad reliable bc most processes run as user
	--&gt; e.g. Darmin = kernel for macOS an iOS
	--&gt; e.g. QNX = real time OS for embedded systems 
	--&gt; cons:
		--&gt; lots of overhead bc all user stuff in separate address spaces
</pre>
<p>
<span id="2.8 OS Structure-Modules"></span><strong id="Modules">Modules</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; loadable kernel modules = kernel has set of core components + link in more components thru modues (boot time or run time)
		--&gt; link services dynamically 
		--&gt; like layered system but more flexible
		--&gt; modules can free call each other + dont need to invoke message passing
	--&gt; best current design (UNIX, linux, windows, macos, solaris)
	--&gt; e.g. linux uses LKMs for device drivers + file systems 
</pre>

<p>
<span id="2.8 OS Structure-macOS and iOS"></span><strong id="macOS and iOS">macOS and iOS</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; primarily layered system 
		1. UX layer: how users interact with computing devices (trackpack, touch screen)
		2. App frameworks layer: cocoa framework tht provide API for objective-C + swift lang
		3. Core frameworks: frameworks to support graphics/media (quicktime, opengl)
		4. Kernel environment: Darwin = mach microkernel + BSD unix kernel
	--&gt; apps can use UX features built in OR directly interact w/ app framework or core framework OR only talk to kernel
	--&gt; has 2 syscalls interfaces to kernel
		1. mach syscalls (traps)
			--&gt; mem management, CPU scheudlign, interprocess com (IPC), remote procedure calls (RPC)
			--&gt; use kernel abstractions (tasks, threads, memm objects, ports)
		2. BSD syscalls  
		--&gt; networkig, security, programing lang support, more 
	--&gt; kernel has I/O kit for device driver dev 
</pre>

<span id="2.8 OS Structure-Android"></span><strong id="Android">Android</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; dev led by google, open source, layered stack w/ many frameworks (like ios)
	--&gt; use java + ahead of time compilation, only compiled into native machine code when installed
	--&gt; google abstracts the hardware, which makes software written for android more portable
	--&gt; use Bionic standard c library for android (good for slower CPUs) 
	--&gt; bottom of software stakc = linux kernel

<pre>
	1. write OS source code (or get someone elses)
	2. configure OS for sys that itll run on
		--&gt; figure out which features included 
		--&gt; config file can be used to modify copy of OS source code, and sys completely compiled
	3. compile OS
	4. install OS
	5. boot computer + new OS

	Building linux system from scratch
	1. download linux source code
	2. configre kernel using "make menuconfig," which gens .config file
	3. compile main kernel using "make"
		--&gt; compiles kernel based on parameters in the .config file
		--&gt; creates vimlinux file = kernel image
	4. compile kernel modules using "make modules," depends on .config file
	5. "make modules_install" to install kernel modules into vmlinuz
	6. install new kernel on system using "make install"
	
	Using VM
	1. donwload ISO image of OS
	2. use ISO as bootable medium in VirtualBox
	3. install

	booting = starting a computer by loading kernel
		1. bootstrap program / boot loader finds kernel
			--&gt; BIOS (mini bootloader) loads another boot loader from the boot block 
			--&gt; UEFI replaces BIOS (supports 64 bit sys + large disks better, not multistage like BIOS) 
			--&gt; can initialize everything in sys (CPU registers, devControllers, main mem)
			--&gt; GRUB = open source bootstrap for linux/UNIX
				--&gt; boot parameters in GRUB config file
				--&gt; flexible, can modify kernel params + select diff kernel at boot time 
				--&gt; creates temp RAM file sys, initramfs, w/ drivers + kernel modules needed to support the real fs, then switch to mem location to boot real fs (android same except keep initramfs)
				--&gt; linux creates systemd process (initial process) + start other processes so comp can run
			--&gt; most bootloaders have recovery mode/single user mode to find hardware issues, corrupt FS, reinstall OS
		3. kernel loaded into mem and started
		4. kernel intializes hardware
		5. root file system mounted 
			--&gt; now system is running

							  top: report real time stats for current processes
		--&gt; system wide: vmstat (report mem usage)
							  netstat (report stat for network interface)
							  iostat (i/o usage for disks)
		--&gt; on linux, counters read stats from /proc = psuedo file sys only in kernel mem
			--&gt; /proc has stats for every process
	--&gt; tracing = data for specific event, e.g. steps in syscall invocation
