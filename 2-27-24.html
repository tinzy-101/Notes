</p>
<pre>
	- logical structure vs where it is physically 
	- file control block per file, explaining what's on it 
	- is layered 
	- need boot control block on device, is pointed to by some info on the disk 
	  
	- use buffers inside mem  
</pre>

<span id="Chapter 14:-Allocation Methods: ON TEST"></span><strong id="Allocation Methods: ON TEST">Allocation Methods: ON TEST</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	1. contiguous allocation: each file is in contiguous blocks 
		- simple, good performance
		- problems: finding space, knowing file size, external frag, need compaction offline or online
		- e.g. how many blocks are in the file TR? 
		  - 3 blocks b/c length = 3 
	2. Linked Allocation 
		- each block is a pointer to the other, are sequential
		- work well for sequential allocation of a file 

File Allocation Table (FAT)
 1. pointer to the next one
 2. directory entry has start block, points to 217, 217 points to 618, 618 points to  ..., etc 
	 	- has 3 blocks (WHY) 

Indexed Allocation 
	1. index block points to 19
	2. 19 contains nums of all the diff blocks that are allocated to the file  
		- can think about these numbers sequentially, or randomly go in with a binary search, looking for something specific 
		- has logical ordering 

Multiple Index Allocation (Mapping) 
	1. outer index points to index table, index table points to file 

Linux UFS: 
	1. Linux UFS 
	2. direct = pointer goes striaght to data
	3. single indirect = pointer goes to pointer to data
	4. doulbe indirect = etc..

<span id="Chapter 14:-Free Space Management"></span><strong id="Free Space Management">Free Space Management</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- fs has free space list 
	- if delete a file, the contents aren't removed from the sector/block, only turns the bit off in the file table 
	  - want to do a hard delete for sensitive data 
	- used linked list to see all your free space
</pre>
<p>
<span id="Chapter 14:-Page Cache"></span><strong id="Page Cache">Page Cache</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- can use caches of pages for files you're reading, use virtual mem
	- e.g. use 4k blocks if virtual mem is 4k
	- set block / cache aside for files
</pre>
<p>
<span id="Chapter 14:-Recovery"></span><strong id="Recovery">Recovery</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- most time need to do from back up 
	- most systems log what's happening, and do correction based on the log (e.g. RAID)

<pre>
	-file organization has to match file allocation
	- if organized as fixed size, need to be allocated a dfixed size 
	
	allocation = how programmers
		- sequential, fixed size, linked, 
		
		sequential, fixed sequential, or direct access file 
			- which will work with linked, sequential allocation set by programmer?
	
	e.g. Data file, organized by fixed size records:
	SSN, Name, and earnings = 1 type of file organization (sequential)
	
	3 types of programmers' logical file organizations:
		- with each organization, need an access method 
	1. sequential: 1 byte/record/block after another, need to be read/written sequentially 
		- access method: SAM or QSAM 
	2. indexed sequential: this uses an index file sorted by some key, e.g. sorted by name 
		- the index file actually points to the record location 
		- access method: ISAM (Available in programming language, needs to talk to file management system to get everything working properly)
	3. direct access: use a key and hash that key to obtain a location in the file 
		- e.g. key hashes to location 3. is 3 empty?
			- if free, place in 3.
			- if not empty, find empty spot and add "art" to the spot. add synonym chain for "art 
			  " to the location 
		- access method: DAM (direct access method) or BDAM (basic DAM)
	
	if os uses 8k size pages, then db will use 8k size pages too 
		- both use list indexing
