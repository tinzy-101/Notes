<div id="Installation"><h3 id="Installation" class="header"><a href="#Installation">Installation</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
go to godot website, download for linux

<li>
unzip folder

<li>
run the Godot.&lt;version stuff&gt;.x86_64

</ol>
<div id="Game Dev Background"><h3 id="Game Dev Background" class="header"><a href="#Game Dev Background">Game Dev Background</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
need assets: sprites, models, textures, sounds --&gt; godot doesnt help creating them, rather putting them together

<li>
can get free assets off the internet --&gt; CC0 = completely free to use + no need to credit

<ul>
<li>
itch.io

<li>
opengameart.org

<li>
kenney.nl

</ul>
</ol>
<div id="Setting up"><h3 id="Setting up" class="header"><a href="#Setting up">Setting up</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
download assets and create folders in bottom right: assets, screens, scripts

<li>
everything is based off of nodes 

<ul>
<li>
if want to creat a player, need to put together a bunch of nodes

</ul>
<li>
need to use scenes 

<ul>
<li>
help to bundle nodes into reusable packages

<li>
can use 1 scene for a character, menu, weapon, or an entire level, etc --&gt; scope is up to you!

<li>
can nest scenes --&gt; e.g. nest player scene inside level 1 scene

<li>
all the scenes create a scene tree --&gt; at the top = root node

</ul>
</ol>
<div id="Creating Player"><h3 id="Creating Player" class="header"><a href="#Creating Player">Creating Player</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
first create a root scene where everything will be organized

<li>
create another scene for the player --&gt; plus sign where the tabs are 

<ul>
<li>
choose type of node: character body 2D

<ul>
<li>
2D physics body for characters moving thru script

</ul>
<li>
need to add graphics 

</ul>
<li>
add a subnode to the characterbody2d for animated sprite 

<ul>
<li>
inspector bar on right changes qualities of a node

<li>
eg. add in sprite frames for animation

<ul>
<li>
under Animation tab on the right side, select sprite frames

<li>
there should be a sprite frames window opneed at the bottom

<li>
got to the grid thingy --&gt; can add sprites from a spread sheet, so open up sprite sheet pdf (many sprites fo animation)

<li>
once you have the sprite sheet, press change the dimensions so that each sprite has its own box

<li>
for animation, press boxes in order you want to play (plays 0--&gt;1)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Once you have created a player, if using pixel are, things will look blurry

<ul>
<li>
fix: project &gt; project settings &gt; rendering &gt; textures &gt; nearest (texture filter)

</ul>
<li>
Playing animation 

<ul>
<li>
press the play button in the small window where all the sprites are

<li>
can increase FPS

</ul>
<li>
Things to adjust 

<ul>
<li>
name the animation --&gt; idle

<li>
enable autoplay --&gt; 3rd button from left --&gt; makes sure character starts moving as soon as game starts

<li>
move the sprite on the big screen so it sits above some "ground" --&gt; middle red line

</ul>
<li>
Error: this node has no shape so it cannot interact with other objects 

<ul>
<li>
this is bc characterbody2D is a physics node --&gt; need to define a shape physics engine can work with

<li>
solution: 

<ul>
<li>
create a new collision node

<li>
create a new circle shape for the collision node

<li>
this circle should rougly line up with the body of the obj, is ok if not perfect

<li>
circle "collider" needs to be generally a bit smaller than body

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Now that we've created a player scene, we can go back to the "game" scene tab and simply drag our player in! 

<ul>
<li>
player shows up in assets

</ul>
</ol>
<div id="Building Game Scene"><h3 id="Building Game Scene" class="header"><a href="#Building Game Scene">Building Game Scene</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
now that you've dragged the player in, also need to have a camera node to control what is being shown on the screen 

<ul>
<li>
ctrl a to search for new node, ctrl+d to center and put yourself in perspective

<li>
should see a pink box outline

</ul>
<li>
camera viewport probably too large so can adjust dimensions on the right --&gt; 4x4 is a safe best

<li>
can move the camera so the player is in the middle or somewhere inside box

<ul>
<li>
now try running the scene --&gt; F6

<li>
i tried running the whole game, but doesnt work bc set to wrong scene maybe; go to project &gt; project setting &gt; applications &gt; run &gt; main scene

</ul>
</ol>
<div id="First Script for Player Movement"><h3 id="First Script for Player Movement" class="header"><a href="#First Script for Player Movement">First Script for Player Movement</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
go back to player tab, make sure player is selected on the left bar (and not any of its subnodes), and add new script

<ul>
<li>
use a template script first, rename to "player," and make sure to place it in our "scripts" folder

</ul>
<li>
with the template, player falls down immediately 

<ul>
<li>
this is because character needs a collider to stand on --&gt; char has own collider, but nothing to collide with!

</ul>
<li>
for static world boundaries:

<ul>
<li>
create new node: staticbody2d in "game"

<li>
under the new node, create collisionshape2d, and select shape to be "new worldboundaryshape2d"

<li>
can rotate the shape so the long side is where the boundary for the other nodes are

<li>
place it under the player node and when playing the game it shouldnt fall through anymore!

</ul>
<li>
once you play the game now, should be able to move left and right with arrow keys  + jump with space 

<ul>
<li>
but moving a bit too fast --&gt; can adjust by changing SPEED and JUMP_VELOCITY vars in the script

</ul>
</ol>
<div id="Worldbuilding!"><h3 id="Worldbuilding!" class="header"><a href="#Worldbuilding!">Worldbuilding!</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
remove the static collider --&gt; going to create new ground for player to stand on

<li>
need to use concept of tiles --&gt; small blocks that make up a whole background 

<ul>
<li>
need a tileset (set of all tiles) to create different tilemaps for each scene --&gt; can do a lot of reusing!

<li>
add new tilemap node to "game"

<li>
on right side select "tileset"

<li>
on bottom go to tileset, instead of tilemap, and drop in your tileset from your assets, select yes to popup

<li>
program automatically detects tiles, but you can use eraser tool as needed to unselect tiles 

<ul>
<li>
e.g. if 1 object is split into multiple tiles, erase, then press shift while dragging to create 1 big tile

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
once you clean up tile map, can start placing tiles! 

<ul>
<li>
make sure game is in select mode and tilemap is in paint mode

<li>
can selecte multiple tiles to place at once, just need to swtich to select mode in tilemap first

</ul>
<li>
adding physics to tilemap 

<ul>
<li>
go to tilemap &gt; tileset on left side, add physics layer

<li>
go to tilemap &gt; physics0 on the bottom

<li>
can start selecting tiles that physics should be applied to (e.g. blocks, but flowers and trees dont need physics bc we want to pass right through)

<li>
some tiles, like the bridge, we dont want the entire tile to be selected, only partially, so we can adjust the box size 

<ul>
<li>
make sure when adjusting, make sure consecutive nodes, like for the bridge, line up! so that the player doesnt get stuck

</ul>
<li>
when finished choosing, if hit play again, should get a real world!

</ul>
<li>
adjusting camera to follow player 

<ul>
<li>
drag the camera node on left side so it is a child of the player node

<li>
since the camera follows really quickly by default, can go to camera and enable position smoothing (5 pixels) so its less headache inducing lol

</ul>
</ol>
<div id="Platforms"><h3 id="Platforms" class="header"><a href="#Platforms">Platforms</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
want to make our game less static! create some moving and non moving platforms --&gt; need to create a new element/scene first

<li>
add animatablebody2d node 

<ul>
<li>
used when want to animate a node but still want the node to collide properly with other objects

<li>
subnode of the platform scene

</ul>
<li>
add sprite 

<ul>
<li>
so that there is an image attached to the node

<li>
drag in platform sprite sheet into right bar &gt; region &gt; enabled &gt; edit region &gt; crop out the other sprites you dont need 

</ul>
<li>
add collisionbody2d 

<ul>
<li>
so that player can collide with it

<li>
set the collision gemoetry to be a rectangle and shape it to match the platform shape

</ul>
<li>
now have a platform! just drag and drop it into the main game scene as a subnode

<li>
want to be able to jump up and enter platform from the bottom 

<ul>
<li>
got to collision2dobject for platform, on right side &gt; onewaycollsion on

</ul>
<li>
if the platform is after the player in the node tree on left side, the player is drawn first and is covered up by the platform 

<ul>
<li>
to fix, can either change the order of nodes in the tree --&gt; NOT dependable

<li>
better: 

<ul>
<li>
go to the player and on the right side &gt; ordering &gt; z index &gt; set to something greater than 0 (e.g. 5)

<li>
by default all scenes have a z index of 0, so follow the ordering of the tree

<li>
if not all the z indices are 0, then go based on highest z index to be drawn last

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
create moving platform 

<ul>
<li>
duplicate the existing platform, and add an animationplayer subnode

<li>
in bottom bar, add new animation

<li>
click on player2 in left bar &gt; position on right bar &gt; key symbol &gt; yes to popup

<li>
move the time bar on the bottom from 0 --&gt; 1 sec (or how ever long you want it to move)

<li>
move the platform to the place you want it to be at the end of the set time frame 

<ul>
<li>
can use shift to lock the node into only 1 axis 

</ul>
<li>
click key again

<li>
can click play button on bottom to see it run

<li>
to get it to loop 

<ul>
<li>
press loop button twice on bottom right

</ul>
<li>
if moving too fast, can adjust time length on bottom right

<ul>
<li>
after adjusting time, need to move the last keyframe to align with the end of the time period

</ul>
<li>
enable autoplay on the bottom right 

<ul>
<li>
so that when game starts and the camera moves to the platform, platform is already moving

</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
<div id="Pickups"><h3 id="Pickups" class="header"><a href="#Pickups">Pickups</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
nodes that can be picked up! good for object-collecting games (like ours tehe)

<li>
create a new scene + new node area2d 

<ul>
<li>
use area2d when you dont want to collide with objects, just want to define an area that can detect collisions

</ul>
<li>
create an animatedsprite2d (bc we want coin to spin) 

<ul>
<li>
on right side, animation &gt; create new sprite frame &gt; on bottom, grid &gt; choose coin sprite sheet &gt; cut up sheet properly, select frames in order

<li>
change to 10fps

<li>
make sure autoplays on bottom left

</ul>
<li>
area2d also needs collision shape bc it is a physics body 

<ul>
<li>
add collisionshape2d with circule smaller than the coin body

</ul>
<li>
now can drag coin into the game!

<li>
getting coin to do stuff when the player comes in contact with it 

<ul>
<li>
go to coin on left side &gt; create new script &gt; default template &gt; save in scripts folder

</ul>
<li>
tidbits on the script 

<ul>
<li>
too see all possible signals: click on the area2d (coin) node on the left bar &gt; on right side click on node

<li>
want to use "enter body" signal, which is triggered when a physics body enters the area2d

<li>
add in signal: double click on it and press connect

<li>
green arrow by function shows that it is triggered by signal

<li>
to test signal works: print something in console!

<li>
to delete the coin when its touched: queue_free --&gt; deletes the entire scene from the rendering tree 

</ul>
<li>
issues with current script: ANY physics body triggers the "+1 coin" output to console 

<ul>
<li>
can either specify in script OR put the player on a new physics layer

<li>
on the player: go the inspector &gt; collisions &gt; on layers &gt; untoggle 1 and toggle 2

<li>
on the coin: go to the inspector &gt; collisions &gt; on masks &gt; untoggle 1 and toggle 2 

<ul>
<li>
mask defines what layers a node collides with, so only want to recognize collisions on layer 2 (where there is only the player!)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
PROBLEM 

<ul>
<li>
when doing (8), the program refuses to recognize when the player enters the area2d of the coin

<li>
however, everything works perfectly fine when the player is on another layer --&gt; issue is when we change the mask of the coin, not sure how to fix

<li>
solution: just make sure that physics bodies other than the player (such as platforms) do not touch the coin

</ul>
<li>
input from arrow key instead of space 

<ul>
<li>
the default program uses the "ui_input" variable as an indication to jump, and ui_input is only mapped to "space" and "enter"

<li>
go to project settings &gt; input map &gt; show built in settings &gt; look for ui_input &gt; add new mapping to up arrow

<li>
now can jump using up arrow and fully rely on keypad

</ul>
</ol>
<div id="Dying 1.0"><h3 id="Dying 1.0" class="header"><a href="#Dying 1.0">Dying 1.0</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
need to limit the camera for when we fall off the tiles, so that it doesnt follow us infinitely 

<ul>
<li>
go to camera &gt; limits on right side bar &gt; set bottom limit

<li>
can find bottom pixel limit by using rule tool and trace from midline (pink) to the bottommost element you have

<li>
also enable smoothing

<li>
now when you die the camera doesnt follow, stays on the current scene

</ul>
<li>
creating killzone -- dangerous area player enters, indication to restart the game

</ol>
