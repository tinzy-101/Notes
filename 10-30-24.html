<ol>
<li>
ask: does the node you want to delete have a left child? 

<ul>
<li>
if yes: 

<ul>
<li>
look at the rightmost element in the left sub tree, fetch content, and overwrite curr node with that value

<li>
when moving the rightmost element up, if there is left sub tree, it should be adopted by the parent as left child

</ul>
<li>
if no: 

<ul>
<li>
give up right subtree to be adopted by ur parent (the right sub's grandparent node)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
if duplicate elements in bst: 

<ul>
<li>
if trying to insert a duplicate values of one of the nodes, go to the left sub tree of that node

</ul>
<li>
deleting with duplicates 

<ul>
<li>
need to figure out which you want to delete or if you want to delete all copies

</ul>
<li>
iterators 

<ul>
<li>
need a uniform way to traversing the elements in the tree

<li>
have an iterator class

<li>
tree.begin() = the root element

<li>
tree.end() = nullptr (moved beyond the bst)

<li>
++iterator = can move the iterator like an index (preinc overloaded for the class)

<li>
want to get iterator object out of bst tree: 

<ul>
<li>
visit all nodes in bst (e.g. in order)

<li>
write the values in the nodes into a vector (NOT the node ptrs)

<li>
traverse the vector of the sorted elemetns, and store the "current" as an index in the vector (current is an int)

</ul>
<li>
an iterator object only stores current + vector of all elements

</ul>
<li>
define begin() and end() 

<ul>
<li>
in the BST tree, NOT in the iterator class 

</ul>
<li>
path function 

<ul>
<li>
given a node in bst tree, it will give the order that you traverse nodes to reach the desired node (stored in vector)

</ul>
<li>
colon means inheritance
