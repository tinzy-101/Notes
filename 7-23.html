Today during breakfast we were eating some peppers with gochujang after we started talking about different homonyms in
korean, like 배 meaning boat, stomach, and pear. 이모 brought up 고추 meaning both pepper and little boy penises LMAOO
Apparently lots of ahjummas would eat lots of peppers whenever their daughters were pregnant in hopes of getting a son
out of it. Then the convo kinda devolved into talking about how Koreans value men so much more than woman, and she
looked so sad omg.....I can tell shes definitely really bitter about stuff. She also keeps saying that food that she 
makes herself isnt good because its a lot of work, and because smelling the food all while cooking it ruins the taste
when she tries to eat it. 
Today in class we went over a bunch of grammar and vocab. It was so freaking humid and stuffy, even with the AC on that
everyone was feeling super tired. I could honestly barely keep my eyes open during class and I felt so bad.
I also tried the galbi onigiri for the first time (lso 1100), and it was so sweet omg i shouldve known, but it was
pretty good. Later in class, Kunkel's new obsession is singing supernova, and during the part where their arms go up and
down and they do the hip pops, he kept singing "bussy bop" it was so bad, hes so 이상해
After class, we went to the student 식당 but after salene fell and we cleaned her up, me laryssa and salene decided it
was a 평의점 kinda day, esp since they were out of katsu and only had bibimbap and shabu shabu, but it was too hot. I got
this kind of buldak kimbap with sausage and cheese, IT WAS SO GOOD, salene was kinda obsessed with it too. I definitely
have to get it again, it was only 3000 won. Me and Ivy also shared 2 smoothies, we got the chocolate strawberry and taro 
smoothies, taro was so sweet, but super good; i prefer the cookies and cream with strawberry tho ngl
After we finished our food, we went to the international studies building for tutoring, where i was super unproductive 
as usual lol, tho i did input some vocab. we had to wait for izzy, ivy, and salene to finish their one on ones so i 
went down to floor 2 to work on some more vocab, and finally finished it omg
On the way there, we started talking about sophie as a roomate and as a person....her and jolie just seem superficial
a lot of the time, especially when she keeps telling 이모 and friends how im do "독독해요", feels like shes just 
trying to compensate for 이모's friends only calling sophie pretty; it seems awkward as hell. Also, the way shes 
constantly shitting on people (jordan, alyssa) and their korean, when her enunciation is kinda shit (sorry, it just
sounds super awkward). very hypocritical of me, but i just feel like she has no place to do that.
they came to collect me when they were done, and we went to the lotte world mall in jamsil! pretty close bye, but kinda
boogie, it was really expensive. HOWEVER there was this studio ghibli store on the 1st floor that was so freaking 
tempting, i wanted the lunch bag but it was too much so i had to think about it. 
We then went to H&amp;M that had some cute stuff, but a lot of it was expensive and looked really cheap. I really wanted
an airism t shirt, but it was 15k, a lil pricey. I did however get a black bikini top thats so cute! Matchinng with ivy
hehe, salene and izzy also got some jeans, they ate that up. we definitely have to go swimming together now, but
we do have to find swimsuit shorts first
After that, I had to go home by 7:30 imaginary curfew, it was kinda sucky but i was tired anyways. I really wanna try 
injeolmi that I saw in the station one day tho, I can prob find in 왕십리 tho.
When we got home, we cooked vegetable pancakes together cause kim seonsaengnim was eating out at the company, and it was
so delicious, but there was so little. apparently 이모 ate 2 ice creams before so she wasnt hungry at all lol. I tried 
the caramel ice cream today and it was SO GOOD, really creamy and sweet, 
after that, we went on a short walk and ran into jo, where we yapped for a while. i was tired tho and barely talked. was
a nice relaxing night

tomorrow: nyu nyu, dong myu market, 아름다운가게, 왕십리
