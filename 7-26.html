Today before class we walked up to the 2nd floor of the humanities building as usual, and the cute guy studying was
there again. He sat in the place that sophie and i usually sit in (whereas the other days, when we suddenly appeared, 
he would sit on the couches), so i went to go sit on the couches. it was might hot and humid outside and it felt so
fucking suffocating ong. but anyways faithlin sent out a notice abouthte stanford CORE co-op bioloy internship app
was being extended to 7/25 by midnight, which meant that I was able to still apply up to 7/26 at 4pm....except i totally
forgot about the app, remembered last night, and decided to not do anything except read manga......and this morning
i woke up panicked trying to finish the 5 essays. we got ther 30 min early and i started the grind lmao, and kept working
on it during the breaks, and worked into lunch too. 
</p>

<p>
Today we learned some new grammar that helped us to compare people to things, like 처럼, 가타요, and so on, it was 
actually pretty funa and memorable! During break I got some chocolate tube thingies and they were pretty buss, solid 
sweet thing to munch on while working on the apps.
</p>

<p>
Because none of us were very hungry, and the lunch menu wasnt that great, we decided to do 편의점 for lunch again today.
I go the cow kimbap for 3k something, and it was pretty dang delicious, even better when microwaved. salene ditched us
again for lunch, so we had a nice lunch with mia and ellie next to us. we started talking about college apps and majors,
and mia was asking for a ton of advice (not that i could help her LOLLL), but ivy and izzie did agree to review my 
transfer essays, so super thankful :)) anyways lunch passed super quickly bc we had to go to taekwondo, and i still had
to shorten some essays to meet the work count, write the challenge essay, and write about my commute. so i did it on the
bus ride over, finished it all, just had to revise and remove words lol! 
</p>

<p>
anyways during class, we finally finishe dthe whole choreo:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
start with everyone bowing in, we do purpose of taekwondo led by gianna

<li>
i lead the counting to 6 for middle punch, low block, middle block, high block, then paroh, shio (for bow)

<li>
we do the kata routine, which i def need to practice, at the climax gianna comes up and does a hammer fist really 
	cooly lol

<li>
6 of us do the jumping front kick first, and we have to yell 3x: before we kick, when we make contact, and after

<li>
the other 4 then do the flying side kick

<li>
we clean up and all come up to the front in a line, and aaliyah leads the ending where we bow and wave 

</ol>
<p>
routine is lowk not that hard, we just need to practice. feeling pretty good.
After the class was over, the sir gave us a pep talk about being successful, but all very halfheartedly, but in a chill
way tho lol. while we were doing our practice routines the relaly nice uni student m'am was also there, and cheered 
for us, so sweet haha. there was also a new boy there who was pretty cute...but looked too young. when we finished, the
nice red hair lady came and gave us all hugs to say goodbye, even though we barely had class with her anymore. laryssa
</p>

<p>
and I got a selfie and her insta!! i love reading her insta stories for korean practice lol. she so sweet i love her
after class, laryssa and i went to hanok, where it was super muggy and felt really miserable. we got these 1+1 grape and
aloe drinks, and i also tried the red bean cream bread for 1.5k won, and it was SO YUMMY!  the cream was a lil salty too
I was kinda sick of walking around ngl, and i said i was bored, and was kinda just standing outside one of the palaces,
and when laryssa came to tell me that they were going somewhere else, i muste said it in a bad way bc she told me really 
sadly that i could leave if i didnt want to be here....lowk felt bad. but we kept looking and it was pretty awk for a bit
but at 5:30ish we left for myeongdong, got off at the station and went around shopping, and met up with salene and ivy
and all was pretty normal again. ps we were at the namsan hanok palace which looked just like 경복궁, but less ornate
</p>

<p>
we found a nice kpop store where i got this exo light stick pin!!! its on my nsliy tote with totoro now and its so 
frekaing cute (5k), i cant wait to move this stuff all to the black backpack. i also ended up getting some stickers 
of EXO lookign stupid lol, it was made to be on my phone and computer hehe. salene and laryssa went feral for the 
skz ate albums and nct + txt, they ended up buying and doing an unboxing. by somme will of god, laryssa got bangchan 
and salene got huening kai photocards LOLL they were super giddy after. after wandering around more inside the station
we went out exit 7 to the street food street. there were so many stalls and a lot of it was lowk overpriced.
also before we left the station, laryssa and i were looking at some socks, and i ended up getting v, jhope, and RM socks
for chris, ivana, and shaan, i aslo copped some totoro socks for myself (only 1500, so cute hehe). while we were there,
this dutch guy and his family asked us if we knew about kpop stuff (he didnt know who bts was), but we was really nice,
and laryssa and i recommended that he get V or jungkook cause they were the most popular haha. he also showed us a 
picture that they took with some BTS statue to send to some girl they knew (she loved it, they were confused) LOL
it was such a fun interation haha 
but me and laryssa saw some 쏘뗙 and had to try it, and it was bomb with some spicy sauce. ivy was gonna get some 
then she saw how he was making it out or prepackaged tteok and sausage skewers lol. but for 4k it was a good amount and
i wasnt too mad, especially cause it was delicious hehe
</p>

<p>
I got home a little past 7:30, and they all waited for me to eat, which was really nice. 이모 went to 멀리 today and had
lunch with her friends, and she did a bunhc of shopping at the market there. she made 3 new side dishes: seaweed, 오이, 
구고마 stem. the 고구마 stem were surprisingly good, they were so freaking good, but they all were tbh. she looked so 
tire, and kim just ate so quickly, felt kinda unappreciative, but who am i to talk. as always, we had ice cream, and i
tried the one with red bean and white around it and it was suprisingly good....like an ice cream parody of the bread
i had today. 
</p>

<p>
after that we went to go rest and sleep....ill also have to go out with imo and kim to eat dinner with a friend, which
will be interesting...hopefully they arent too out of pocket omg
</p>

<p>
