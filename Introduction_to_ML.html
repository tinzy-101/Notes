	scikit-learn = python framework to implement ML algos, good starting point
	tensorflow = more complicated library, used for distributed numerical computation
					 train large neural networks efficiently, computations over many GPUs
	keras = high level deep learning API, easy to train neutral networks + run them 
	
	Part 1: introduction 
		- why ML
		- steps in ML project
		- how to fit model to data
		- optimize cost function
		- how to clean, handle, prepare data
		- selectng and engineering features
		- choosing model
		- common learning algos: linear and polynomial regression, logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, ensemble methods
		- reduce dimensionality of training data
		- other unsupervised learning techniques: clustering, density estimation
