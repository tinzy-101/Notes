	1. save current state of CPU + other relevant sys info
	2. determine source of interrupt + action to take
	3. perform action
	4. restore the previous state of the CPU + other relevant sys info
	5. return control to the interrupted pocess/task

new --&gt; ready from long term/master scheduler (would execute if it had a cpu) 
	--&gt; can go into suspended mem story w/ swapper/intermediate term scheduler
dispatcher/short term scheduler picks process in ready list to run, then that process is in the executing state
2 options when process is executing: 
	1. external interupt that needs OS
	2. goes into service request blocked state 
		--&gt; back to ready list when service completed 
		--&gt; can go into suspended blocked state from swapper
		--&gt; then go into suspended ready, and finally ready to be executed 
	3. terminates normally/abnormally (terminated state)

	how do PCBs fit in?
		--&gt; system pointer lets u drop to anything in system table w/ PCB, which points to Thread control block (TCB)
			--&gt; sys pointer also points to device controllers, OS queues, fixed address locations
		--&gt; resident = never swapped out, always in main mem (abslute, relational (resident), virtual addresses)
		--&gt; if vectored interrupt happens:
			1. cpu save current PC in temp area
			2. load address of interrupt handler
				--&gt; timer interrupt handler

<span id="Chapter 3:-Context Switch"></span><strong id="Context Switch">Context Switch</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; CPU switches to another process, sys saves state of old process, load saved state of new process = context switch
	--&gt; context of process is in the PCB
	--&gt; context switching is overhead! sys not doing useful stuff while switching 
	--&gt; time depends on hardware support
		--&gt; 1 CPU = 1 counter = only run 1 program at a time

<pre>
	1. interrupt occurs (externel from timer / disk I/O, internal with trap)
	2. hardware does this:
			  1. save current program counter (absolute known address to hardware)
			  2. save timer value 
	3. if timer interrupt (software, wasting time for OS):
			  1. vector 010 into CPU
			  2. turn off interrupt
			  3. execute timer handler
			  4. go back to kernel dispatcher to find next process to execute 
	4. process b chosen to run
			  1. runs, then times out
			  2. save PC + current time (zero time, none left)
			  3. load timer handler, executes
			  4. go back to dispatcher to pick another process to run
