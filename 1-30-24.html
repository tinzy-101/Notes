<pre>
	goal: pick most effective use of CPU, can't do anything without it
	--&gt; need multiprogramming to get max CPU use 
	--&gt; CPU processes are CPU bound or I/O bound (burst of CPU then I/O, cycle)

<span id="Chapter 5: CPU scheduling-CPU Scheduler"></span><strong id="CPU Scheduler">CPU Scheduler</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; short term scheduler = dispatcer
	--&gt; queue can be ordered + different scheduling decisions
		1. process running to waiting (blocked)
		2. running to ready (timed out)
		3. waiting to ready
		4. terminate
	--&gt; preemptive vs nonpreemptive
		1 &amp; 4 nonpreemptive: give process processor until its finished (can handle interrupts, but always goes back to o.g. process)
		2 &amp; 3 (and all other scheduling) preemptive: timeout, higher priority process enters ready queue,  
</pre>
<p>
<span id="Chapter 5: CPU scheduling-Dispatcher"></span><strong id="Dispatcher">Dispatcher</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	-&gt; dispatcher gives control of CPU to process selected
		1. switch context
		2. switch to user mode
		3. jump to right place in user program to restart
	--&gt; dispatcher latency: takes time to stop 1 process and start another (not always in this order tho)
</pre>

<span id="Chapter 5: CPU scheduling-Scheduling Criteria"></span><strong id="Scheduling Criteria">Scheduling Criteria</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	1. CPU as busy as possible --&gt; max 
	2. throughput as high as possible (based on num processes completed) --&gt; max
	3. turnaround = time to exec 1 specific process --&gt; min
	4. wait time = amt time process in ready queue (NOT blocked state, when process just waiting) --&gt; min
	5. response time = amt time request submitted to first response produced --&gt; min

	e.g. P1 needs 24 burst time, P2 needs 3, P3 needs 3
	**NONPREEMPTIEVE!! --&gt; no time quantum that will bump process from CPU resources

</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; each process gets priority num
	--&gt; CPU gets process with highest priority (usually, smaller num = higher priority, depends on OS)
	--&gt; SJF is a specific type of priority scheduling (priority if inverse of prediced next CPU burst time)
	--&gt; problem: starvation
		--&gt; some low priority processes may never execute 
		solution: age the process, overtime in ready state, boost the priority
			--&gt; if time out, cna choose whether to go back to o.g. priority or go to new priority

<span id="Chapter 5: CPU scheduling-Scheduling mechs-Round Robin"></span><strong id="Round Robin">Round Robin</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; everyone uses it for something
	--&gt; time quantum for each process, slice of CPU time (10-100ms)
	--&gt; when time is up, process is preempted + added to end of ready queue
	--&gt; (n-1)q max time units for process wait
		--&gt; n = num processes
		--&gt; q = time quantum
	--&gt; timer interrupts every quantum to schedule next process
	--&gt; performance:
		1. queue large --&gt; FIFO
		2. q small --&gt; q has to be large compared to context switch, or else too high overhead (context switching too much)
	--&gt; e.g. RR w/ time quantum=4: P1 = 24 burst time, P2 = 3, P3 = 3
		--&gt; P1 --&gt; P2 --&gt; P3 --&gt; P1 --&gt; P1 (etc until P1 finished) 
		--&gt; don't need context switch or change to ready list when get to continuously running P1, just stay in execute state (dispatcher will look ahead and see nothing in ready queue)

		--&gt; foreground (RR), background (FCFS)

<div id="Chapter 5: CPU scheduling-Example: multilevel feedback queue"><h4 id="Example: multilevel feedback queue" class="header"><a href="#Chapter 5: CPU scheduling-Example: multilevel feedback queue">Example: multilevel feedback queue</a></h4></div>
<pre>
		--&gt; queues go left to right 
		--&gt; L1 - L3 = differet level queues
			--&gt; L1 = 2 units timeout quantum (FCFS)
			--&gt; L2 = 3 quantum timeout (FCFS
			--&gt; L3 = 4 units
		--&gt; no CPU units registered during process transition (ignore OS) 
		--&gt; processes need CPU units: A = 4, B = 2, C = 1, D = 7
			1. process A enters running state (from L1 ready queue to processor) 
			2. D is at level 1, first in line
			3. B level 2, first in line
			4. C level 3, first in line
			5. proess E enters level 1 after 7 CPU units, needing 1 unit 
		--&gt; when process times out of unit, it gets placed on next lower queue in ready list
			--&gt; e.g. A times out after 2 units, go to level 2 (FCFS)
				--&gt; if A times out level 2, go to end of level 3 (Round robin) 
				--&gt; A will round robin until terminate or request service
					--&gt; if request service, go back to level 1 and start whole mechanism again
		--&gt; handles both I/o bound and CPu bound processes well 
		Time 1: constant
		Time 2: constant
		Time 3: A times out, D bumped into processor, A bumped behind B in L2
		Time 4: Same, D needs 4, and it gets 2 from L1 (2 is cap on L1)
		Time 5: D times out, gets bumped to L2, B starts exec
		Time 6: same, L3 give u 3 units, but B only needs 2 so this is its last time in chart
		Time 7: B terminates and leaves, A bumps in and executes for 1 time 
		Time 8: E enters L1 and preempts A, gets processor, A is bumped back to first in line at L2
				--&gt; write A2 instead of A, bc A was preempted! show that A only gets 2 more time slots out of the 3 time slots avail on L2 (but remember A only needs 1 more! alrd executed 3 times)
		Time 9: E terminates (only needs 1 unit), A2 gets CPU, D moves up in queue, C cst
		Time 10: A2 terminates, D moved onto queue, still has 3 possible units (but needs 5)
		Time 11: same, D still gets 2 more units
		Time 12: same, D still gets 2 more units
		Time 13: D times out, gets bumped to L3, C gets the CPU now
		Time 14: C only needed 1 time quantum, so terminates, and D moves back in
