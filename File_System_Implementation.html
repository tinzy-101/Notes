	- fs = permanently on secondary storage, access large amounts of data 
	- os provides many fs, b/c diff performance, reiability, goals, purposes

	- disks are most common secondary storage used b/c:
	  1. can read from block, modify block, and write it back to same block
	  2. disk can access any block of info it has by rotating read-write heads 
	  
	- NVMs are starting to be used more, can't be written in place + diff performance chars compared to hdds 
	 
	- i/o efficiency = want to perform i/o b/w mem and mass storage in blocks 
	  - each block on hdd has 1+ sectors
	  - sector = 512 bytes - 4096 bytes 
	
	- fs = convenient access to storage device, but need to make interface user-friendly + way to map logical fs to physical storage 
	  - diff levels: 
		 	1. app programs
			2. logical fs 
					- manages metadata = fs structure except actual data / file contents 
					- manages dir structure + give file-organization module neeeded info 
					- file control block (FCB) = info about the file
					- needs to protect system 
			3. file organization module 
					- store info about files and logical blocks 
					- file labeled 0 or 1 to N
					- has free space maanger,t racks unallocated blocks and give them to the module 
			4. basic file system 
					- issues generic commands to correct device driver to read/write blocks on storage device 
					- uses logical block addresses
					- i/o request sceduling, manage mem buffers/caches 
			5. i/o control 
					- device drivers + interrupt handlers to transfer info b/w main mem + disk system 
					- device driver = translator b/w high level and low level 
					  - writes bit patterns to i/o controllers mem to tell controller which dev to act on + actions to take
			6. devices 
		
		- layering is good b/c less duplication, but hard to figure out what to layer

</p>
<pre>

Storage Structures on Disk 
	1. boot control block 
			- info needed by sys to boot os
			- can be empty if does not have OS 
			- usually first block of a volume 
			- "boot block" or "partition boot sector" 
	2. volume control block 
			- volume details = num blocks in volume, size of blocks, free block count, free block pointers 
			- "superblock" or "master file table" 
	3. directory structure 
			- used to organize files (file names, associated inode nums) 
	4. per-file FCB 
			- details about file + special identifier num to be associated w/ directory entry 

Storage Structures in Mem
	1. mount table 
			- info about each mounted volume 
	2. dir structure cache 
			- dir info of dirs that were recently accessed 
	3. system-wide open-file table 
			- copy of FCB for each open file 
	4. per-process open-file table 
			- pointers to correct entries in system-wide open-file table 
	5. buffer to old file system blocks (if blocks being read from/written to fs) 

Creating new File
	1. process calls logical fs (logical fs knows format of dir structures)
	2. logical fs allocates new FCB
	3. system reads correct dir into mem + update with new file name and FCB
	4. write back to fs

<span id="14.2 File System Operations-Usage"></span><strong id="Usage">Usage</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	1. after create new file, can use file for I/O
	2. open() file, need to first search if file is alr being used by another process 
	3. if file is already being used, create per-process open-file table pointin to sys-wide open file tables 
	4. if file not already open, search directory structure for file (usually cached in mem) 
			- find file + copy FCB to system-wide open file table in mem 
			- system-wide open file table tracks num processe w/ the file open
	5. Make entry in per-process open-file table + pointer to entry in sys-wide open file table 
			- open() returns pointer to correct entry in per process fs table 
			  - do all file operations with the poninter 
			- entry in 
	6.
