	thermodynamic system = anything that has interesting thermodynamic properties
		--&gt; engages w/ environment thru boundary 
	
	isolated system = system comepletely separated from environment 
		--&gt; doesn't really exist unless whole universe is in system 
		--&gt; most systems open = exchange nrg/matter with surroundings 
		
	assume sys in equilibrium + look at macroscopic temp changes 
		--&gt; thermal equilibrium = same temp 
		
	0th law of thermodynamics: T1 = T2 and T1 = T3, then T2 = T3
		--&gt; equaiton of state: f(p, V, T) = 0 
			--&gt; for closed sys: relationship b/w pressure, volume, temp = 0
			--&gt; e.g. f(p, V, T) = pV - nRT = 0
			
	extensive variable = deal w/ amount of matter
	intensive variable = don't deal w/ amount of matter
