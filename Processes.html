	--&gt; process = proram in execution that needs resources (CPU time, mem, files, i/o)
		--&gt; OS process executes sys code, user process executes user code, all at once 
		--&gt; modern processes have multiple threads of control 
		--&gt; OS needs to schedule threads onto available processing cores
			--&gt; programmers can design CPU schedulers 
	--&gt; b4: 1 program execute at a time, use all resources 
	--&gt; now: processs is unit of work of OS 
		--&gt; system = collection of processes (user code + os code) 
</pre>

<span id="3.1 Process concept-Process Concept"></span><strong id="Process Concept">Process Concept</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; b4: job, now use prcess 
	--&gt; status of current activity of process = program counter + content inside processo registers
	--&gt; mem layout of process:
		--&gt; text section = executable code (same size) 
		--&gt; data section = global vars (same size)
		--&gt; heap section = dynamically allocated mem during program run time (change size)
			--&gt; grow when mem dynamically allocated, shrink when give mem back 
		--&gt; stack section = temp data storage when invoking funcs (change size)
			--&gt; activation record (func params, local vars, etc) pushed onto stack when func called
			--&gt; return from func, then activation record popped from stack 
		--&gt; stack and heap grow towards eachother, cant overlap
	--&gt; program --&gt; processs when exec loaded into mem
	--&gt; process can be exec envir for other code (e.g. java virtual machine)

<span id="3.1 Process concept-Process state"></span><strong id="Process state">Process state</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; as process execs, change state
		1. new: process created
		2. running: instructions exec
		3. waiting: process waiting for event (i/o compelte, recieve signal)
		4. ready: process wait to be assigned to processor
		5. terminated: process finish exec
	--&gt; only ONE process can run on any processor core at any instance
	--&gt; state change flow:
			new --&gt; ready --&gt; running --&gt; terminated OR waiting 
			waiting --&gt; ready (finish I/O) --&gt; running --&gt; terminated OR ready
			running --&gt; ready (time out-inerrupt) --&gt; running --&gt; terminated

<span id="3.1 Process concept-Process Control Block (PCB)"></span><strong id="Process Control Block (PCB)">Process Control Block (PCB)</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; every process repped by process control block (task control block) in OS
		1. process state (above)
		2. program counter = address of new instruction for the process
		3. CPU registers = holds state info when interrupt occurs, so process can be continued correctly (accumulators, index regs, stack pointers, general purpose regs)
		4. CPU scheduling info = process priority, pointer to scheduling queue, etc
		5. mem management info = base/limit reg values + page tables
		6. acct info = CPU/real time used, time limits, acct num, job/process nums
		7. i/o status info = i/o dev allocated to process, open files list
</pre>

<span id="3.1 Process concept-Threads"></span><strong id="Threads">Threads</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; 1 thread of control = process can only do 1 task at a time
	--&gt; most modern OS let process have multiple threads of exec = multiple tasks at once

<pre>
	--&gt; multiprogramming = have 1 process running at all times so CPU efficient 
	--&gt; time sharing = CPU core switch among processes quickly so user can use all programs 
		--&gt; process scheduler choose avail process for program exec on a core
		--&gt; every core runs 1 process at a time
		--&gt; degree of multiproramming = num of processes currently in mem
	--&gt; i/o bound vs cpu bound
		--&gt; i/o bound process = more time doing i/o than computations
		--&gt; CPU bound process = most time computations
</pre>
<p>
<span id="3.2 Process scheduling-Scheduling queues"></span><strong id="Scheduling queues">Scheduling queues</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	1. processer enter sys, put on ready queue (linked list w/ pointers to first PCB in list, each PCB has pointer to next PCB in ready queue)
	2. process leaves ready state when allocated CPU core 
		--&gt; exec until terminate, interrupted, or waiting for event to finish (i/o) 
		--&gt; wait queue = for processes waiting for event
		--&gt; process can create new child process + in new wait queue for child to finish
		--&gt; process can be forece removed from core: interrupt, time expire --&gt; back to ready
	--&gt; queuing diagram shows types of queues present
		--&gt; mostly ready queue + set of wait queues 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="3.2 Process scheduling-CPU scheduling"></span><strong id="CPU scheduling">CPU scheduling</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; CPU scheduler chooses which process in ready queue to get CPU core 
	--&gt; even tho CPU-bound process needs CPU for longer, usually doesnt get special treatment
		--&gt; CPU switch processes every 100 millisecs, or more
	--&gt; some CPUs use swapping
		-- swapping = move process to disk from main mem to save status, move back when mem has space
</pre>
<p>
<span id="3.2 Process scheduling-Context Switch"></span><strong id="Context Switch">Context Switch</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; when interrupt, sys needs to save current context of process on CPU core, so can restore context when core starts running the process again 
		--&gt; state save &amp; state restore
	--&gt; context repped by PCB (CPU regs, process state, mem management info)
	--&gt; context switch time = overhead, microsecs

<pre>
	--&gt; can from a process tree when parents create children processes
	--&gt; identify processes using processor identifier (pid) = int unique to every process in sys
		--&gt; e.g. linux:
			systemd (pid = 1)
			--&gt; logind (8415): manage clients logging into sys directly
				--&gt; bash (8416)
					--&gt; ps (9298)
					--&gt; vim (9204)
			--&gt; python (2808)
			--&gt; sshd (3028): manage clients logging into sys thru ssh
				--&gt; sshd (3610)
					--&gt; tcsh (4005)
	--&gt; parent creating children processes:
		--&gt; parent processes need to share resources with children
			--&gt; this way parent cant overload sys by creating too many children
		1. parent needs to execute concurrently with childnre
		2. parent waits til children finish 
		--&gt; child can be a duplicate of parent OR have a new program loaded into it
		--&gt; e.g. UNIX:
			1. fork() sys call creates new process
			2. return code for child process = 0, return code for parent = nonzero
			3. both processes use exec() syscall to load bin file into mem to start executing 
		--&gt; e.g. windows:
			1. create new process w/ CreateProcess()
			2. need to load specific program into address spae of child when child created 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="3.3 Operations on processess-Process Termination"></span><strong id="Process Termination">Process Termination</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; process execs last statement + ask OS to delete using exit() syscall 
		--&gt; OR one process uses syscall to terminate another process (usually parent to child)
			1. bc child using too much resources
			2. child no longer needed
			3. parent exiting and os doesnt let child live (unless cascading termination)
	--&gt; process returns status to waiting parent process (wait())
	--&gt; all resources deallocated and returned to OS
		1. still has entry in process table until parent calls wait() 
			--&gt; zombie process = terminated but parent not called wait()
			--&gt; orphan process = parent didnt invoke wait() and terminates 
				--&gt; init process assigned as new parent (or systemd)	
</pre>

<span id="3.3 Operations on processess-Android process hierarchy"></span><strong id="Android process hierarchy">Android process hierarchy</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; importance hierarchy of processes 
		1. foreground process: visible on screen
		2. visible process: not visible but has performance that foreground process refers to
		3. service process: like bakground process but performs activity obvious to user (music)
		4. background process: activity not obvious to user
		5. empty process: no active components to do with any app
	--&gt; first terminate empty process, then go up

<div id="3.4 Interprocess communication"><h3 id="3.4 Interprocess communication" class="header"><a href="#3.4 Interprocess communication">3.4 Interprocess communication</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	--&gt; processes going concurrently in OS can be:
		1. independent = doesn't share data w/ other processes
		2. cooperating = can affect or be affected by other processes
			--&gt; info sharing
			--&gt; computation speedup (task broken into subtasks that work together)
			--&gt; modularity (sys divided into sep. processes/threads) 
	--&gt; cooperating processes need interprocess communication(IPC)
		1. shared mem 
			--&gt; block of mem shared by 2 processes, read and write data to block 
			--&gt; faster (only need syscalls to set up mem regions + don't need kernel) 
		2. message passing 
			--&gt; send messages between processes 
			--&gt; good for small data + easier to configure 
			--&gt; slower (uses syscalls + kernel)
		--&gt; most sys use both 
</pre>


<div id="3.5 IPC in shared-mem systems"><h3 id="3.5 IPC in shared-mem systems" class="header"><a href="#3.5 IPC in shared-mem systems">3.5 IPC in shared-mem systems</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	--&gt; shared mem region is in address space of process that created it
		--&gt; collaborating process needs to attach it to their address space also 
	--&gt; producer and consumer processes
		1. producer produces info consumed by consumer (compiler produced assembly code for assembler)
		2. server = producers, client = consumer
		3. solution: shared mem! 
		--&gt; need buffer of items filled by producer and consumed by consumer
			1. unbounded buffer: no practical limit on buffer size (producer can keep producing)
			2. bounded buffer: fixed size (consumer waits if buffer empty, producer wait it buffer full) 
				--&gt; buffer implemented in circular array w/ in/out pointers
				--&gt; buffer empty if (in == out), full if ((in+1) % bufferSize) == out)
				--&gt; can only have bufferSize-1 items in buffer at once 
</pre>


<div id="3.6 IPC in message-passing systems"><h3 id="3.6 IPC in message-passing systems" class="header"><a href="#3.6 IPC in message-passing systems">3.6 IPC in message-passing systems</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	--&gt; useful in distributed environment (process on diff computers) 
	--&gt; need send(message) and recieve(message)
	--&gt; difficult to implement sys with variable message sizes, easier with fixed size
	--&gt; need communication link b/w processes b4 can send and recieve messages
		1. physical link:
			--&gt; shared mem, hardware bus, network
		2. logical link 
			--&gt; direct/indirect communication
			--&gt; synch/asynch communication
			--&gt; auto/explicit buffering
</pre>
<p>
<span id="3.6 IPC in message-passing systems-Naming"></span><strong id="Naming">Naming</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; direct com vs indirect com
		1. direct com: need to explicitly name recipient/sender 	
			--&gt; send(P, message): send message to P
			--&gt; recieve(Q, message): recieve message from Q
			--&gt; link established automatically, processes only need to know their idnetities 
			--&gt; only 1 link per 2 processes (symmetry)
				--&gt; if asymmetric, recipient doesn't need to name sender
			--&gt; con of symmetric and asymmetric: process defs not modular, hard coded
		2. indirect com: message send/recieved from mailboxes/ports 
			--&gt; send(A, message): send message to mailbox A
			--&gt; recieve(A, message): recieve message from mailbox A
			--&gt; properties:
				1. link processes iff have shared mailbox
				2. link can be for 2+ processes
				3. 2 processes can have multiple links (1 for each mailbox)
			--&gt; mailbox owned by process or OS 
				1. process owns mailbox (mailbox in process address space)
					--&gt; owner (only recieve) and user (only send) 
					--&gt; syscalls can let owner start to send messages too
				2. OS owns mailbox
					--&gt; OS needs mech to let process create new mailbox, send/recieve, delete mailbox

<span id="3.6 IPC in message-passing systems-Synchronization"></span><strong id="Synchronization">Synchronization</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; message passing is blocking/non-blocking (synch/asynch)
		1. blocking send: sending process blocked until message recieved
		2. nonblocking send: process sends message and does other stuff
		3. blocking recieve: reciever blocks until message avail
		4. nonblocking recieve: reciever retrieve valid message or null 
	--&gt; rendezvous: both send and recieve are blocking 
		--&gt; works well for client/server and consumer/producer problem 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="3.6 IPC in message-passing systems-Buffering"></span><strong id="Buffering">Buffering</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	1. zero capacity: link cannot have messages waiting (sender needs to block) (no buffering)
	2. bounded capacity: only n messages can be in queue, if link full sender needs to block
	3. unbounded capacity: queue potentiall infinite (automatic buffering)

</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; POSIX has an API to use shared mem (can use message passing too tho)
	--&gt; use mem-mapped files (shared mem regions associated with fileP
		1. process creates shared mem object using syscall
			--&gt; fd = shm_open(name, O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0666)
			--&gt; name = name of sared mem object
			--&gt; O_CREAT = created shared-mem object if not yet created
			--&gt; O_RDWR = object open for reading and writing
			--&gt; 0666 = for file-access permissions of shared-mem obj 
		2. configure size of obj 
			--&gt; ftructrate(fd, 4096) = 4096 bytes
		3. create mem mapped file w/ shared-mem obj + return poitner to mem-mapped file 
			--&gt; mmap()

<span id="3.7 Examples of IPC systems-Mach message passing"></span><strong id="Mach message passing">Mach message passing</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; Mach OS used for distributed systems so use message passing 
	--&gt; create tasks (like processes, but have multiple threads of control + less resource)
	--&gt; send messages to ports (mailboxes w/ finite size + unidirectional)
		--&gt; have different port to send and recieve
		--&gt; every port has 1+ sender, only 1 reciever 
	--&gt; use kernel abstractions to represent resources 
	--&gt; port rights = capabilities needed for task to interact with port 
		--&gt; e.g. task needs MACH_PORT_RIGHT_RECIEVE for a created port 
		--&gt; rights = name of port (int)
	--&gt; when task created, Task Self + Notify port created
		--&gt; Task Self lets task send messages to kernel
		--&gt; Notify lets kernel send notification of even occurrences 
		--&gt; bootstrap port = task can register port it creates with bootstrap server 
	--&gt; mach_port_allocate() creates new port + give it space for message queue
	--&gt; queue for eac port is finite + empty
		--&gt; all messages same prioties, FIFO
		--&gt; fixed size message header (size + source/destination ports)
		--&gt; has body with data
	--&gt; simple vs complex messages
		1. simple = user data, not interpreted by kernel
		2. complex = pointers to mem w/ data (good for lots of data), transfter port rights 
	--&gt; mach_msg() = api used to send and recieved messages 
		--&gt; if queue full:
		1. wait indefinitely
		2. wait til n millisecs
		3. return immediately
		4. temp cache message (For server tasks)
