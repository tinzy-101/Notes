Today we went to an ethiopian restaurant with the host fam. Drive over was stressful, 꿀떡 was pissed on the car ride over, started growling and whining. We left the car and the fam realized they forgot someone’s phone and they had to go back to the parking garage. When we finally got to the restaurant, we walked in and it was filled with black people, the host family was so surprised LOL, it felt like a mistake to bring them there. We are probably the weirdest group composition they’ve seen: 2 white girls, an older Korean couple, and a lil white dog. As soon as we sat down 꿀뗙 was growling and chewing on her black bag cause she hated being in it. Also 김선생님 was dragging 꿀떡 as we walked, was a lil scary. When we sat down, all the staff was also sitting down and drinking tea I think? Probably too relaxed-looking for 김선생; he made a few comments about how Ethiopian restaurants were much slower than Korean restaurants. We ordered 3 veg platters, I think they were trying to accomodate Sophie being vegetarian. The food took about 40min to come lol, all the while 꿀떡 was mad, 영애이모 was asking if Ethiopian people look like Americans, and asked us how to say “is the food almost ready” in English. 김선생님 also drank 3 beers while we waited, which 영애이모 was not happy about lol, cause he’s supposedly on a diet. And cause he’s fat lol. They also insisted on ordering in English instead of us, it seemed the staff mainly spoke English but could also speak Korean. Too ironic....XD 김선생님 and 영애이모 probably experienced real culture shock for the first time, and in Korean no less LOL. Was today a mistake? Maybe. But twas fun, pretty hilarious experience to look back at. Everyone was probably thinking wtf we were doing in there, together. Surprisingly, no one really cared about 꿀떡tho we did get some looks haha. Sophie said she was glad I was there along with her cause that could’ve been so much more awkward alone lol; thank god for roommates Also, now, on the car ride home, 김선생님won’t stop staying “OK MARI” “GOOD MARI” and “THANK YOU MARI.” No idea what Mari means, but I can only constantly think about the animal counter, and my mistake “우리 가족은 네마리이에요“ LOL I’ll never live that down, 영앵이모 will forever introduce me using that mistake HAHA.

Ok actually turns out “ok Mari” was “ok body”, wtf. Good body??? Also he’s low key really creepy: 

1.    When I told him I was Czech, he made a curving motion with his hands, and saying that Czech women are like that 
2.  His wife told us that when he travels he learns “I love you you’re beautiful” in that language and tells every girl on the street. She says she’s mad, but he’s just joking (is he tho???)
3. At home he locks himself in his room and is yelling on his phone a lot. She seems embarrassed of him and tells us that he’s just kidding and jsut talks loud. He doesn’t interact with us much, besides telling Sophie that she’s a “beautiful lady” 
4. He’s pretty religious, doesn’t really like that Sophie and I aren’t religious. When we told them in the car that neither of us are religious on the car ride to the octopus place that first night, we sat in silence for a solid 5 min before imo tried to lighten the mood LOL. He really wants to take us to see the church, and after go eat together I. The church restaurant. Next Sunday hopefully it doesn’t rain so I can go to bukhansan with Larissa, and not go to church lol.

Anyways, once we went home, SOphie and I helped 영애이모 take out and sort all the trash, was fun hahaha, especially looking all dressed up. I wore the new blue dress I bought after 영애이모 ironed it for me, and sophie put this liquid face glitter like eyeliner on all three of us. After we sorted out all the trash, we took a short walk with 꿀떡. Sophie practiced her Supernova dance, and we did some model walks around the (dry) fountain; 이모 showed us how haha. Super fun end to the night. Then, like always, we sat in the 명동 자리 (good place) for a while with 꿀떡. We talked about the food; 이모 said the food was just "괜찮아요" lolll she probably didn't like it very much but was just tyring to be polite. Glad she at least ate it though!!

Until next time,

Tina
