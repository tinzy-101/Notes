<p>
System models:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
non virtual machine: hardware --&gt; kernel --&gt; processes

<li>
virtual machine: hardware --&gt; kernel --&gt; processes (several kernels and process threads) 

</ul>
<p>
History:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
ibm started vms so systems guys could test their solutions to bugs in vms, and not have to work odd hours to fix these problems

</ul>
<p>
Benefits and Features 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
host system protected from VMs, VMs protected from each other

<li>
freeze, suspend running VM	

<li>
good for OS dev and research

</ul>
<p>
Trap and emulate:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
how to switch from virtual user mode to virtual kernel mode? 

<ul>
<li>
use trap-and-emulate: VMM gain control, analyze error, and execute operation, then return controll to VM in user mode 

</ul>
</ul>
		 
<p>
binary translation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
when trying to run an OS on a different host, it might have diff CPU (diff machine instruction sets)

<li>
need to use emulation to perform binary translation of instrucion sets 

</ul>
	  
<p>
nested page tables:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
VM needs to manage pages and page tables (2 OSes thing they own the page tables)

<li>
can have control in hardware 

<li>
can have many levels of virtual addressing 

</ul>
<p>
types of VMs and implementations:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
type 0 hypervisor 

<ul>
<li>
VMM is in firmware, OS doesn't need to do anything special 

</ul>
<li>
type 1 hypervisor 

<ul>
<li>
have series of OSes linked together and have cloning

<li>
run in kernel mode

<li>
they don't know they're running VM

<li>
moving towards hardware

</ul>
<li>
type 2 hypervisor 

<ul>
<li>
little OS involvement in virtualization

<li>
poor overall performance

<li>
don't take advantage of CPUs

</ul>
<li>
paravirtualization 

<ul>
<li>
VMM provides services that guest must be modified to used

<li>
icnreased performance

<li>
almost virtualization (para)

<li>
xen = very good example

<li>
emulation != virtualization!!

</ul>
</ol>
<p>
How to schedule CPU w/ different OSes:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
