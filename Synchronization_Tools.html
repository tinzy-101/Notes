	--&gt; cooperating process = can affect + be affected by other processes in system 
		--&gt; can share address space (code+data) or only share data (mem sharing / message pass)
	--&gt; if 2 processes using same mem, can mean inconsistencies

	--&gt; problem: bc of context switching, processes can be cut off when executing
		--&gt; concurrent + parallel execution means problems for data integrity
		--&gt; e.g. bounded buffer to share mem for processes
			--&gt; o.g. solution: only have BUFFER_SIZE-1 items in the buffer 
			--&gt; issue: producer and client operating on same mem, and try to change value of variable at the same time 
			--&gt; race condition = several processes try to manipulate same data same time 
			--&gt; solution: process synchronization + coordination among cooperating processes

<div id="6.2 The critical section problem"><h3 id="6.2 The critical section problem" class="header"><a href="#6.2 The critical section problem">6.2 The critical section problem</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	--&gt; every process in a system has a segment of code = critical selection 
		--&gt; used to update/access data shared w/ other processes 
	--&gt; if one process operating in its critical section, other processes can't touch it 
	--&gt; processes need to request access to enter (entry section + remainder section + exit section in critical section)
	--&gt; solution to critical selection problem:
		1. mutual exclusion = no processes can execute in their critical sections if 1 process is
		2. progress = if no process executing in critical section + some processes want to enter critical sections, then only processes not executing in their remainder sections can be selected to enter their critical section next
		3. bounded waiting = there is a bound on num times other processes can enter critical sections after process has made a request + request is granted 
	--&gt; assume every process running at nonzero speed 
	--&gt; kernel processes especially suceptible to race conditions w/ critical sections in OSes 
		--&gt; nonpreemptive kernel: only 1 process active in kernel at a time
		--&gt; preemptive kernel: need to be designed carefully so that no race conditions
			--&gt; pro: more responsive, b/c less risk that kernel mod process runs a long tim
						--&gt; good for real time process

<div id="6.3 Peterson's Solution"><h3 id="6.3 Peterson's Solution" class="header"><a href="#6.3 Peterson's Solution">6.3 Peterson's Solution</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	--&gt; doesn't necessarily work for modern computer sys b/c have reordered instructions, but is a good algorithmic way to tackle crtical section problem
	--&gt; params: 2 processes that alternate exec b/w their critical and remainder sections, processes share 2 data items, turn variable to let process access critical sec (turn==1 means process 1)
	--&gt; solution: 
					1. P1 sets flag1 as true and sets "turn" to value 2
					2. shows other processes that they can enter critical section (After)
					3. if 2 processes try to set "turn" var, then 1 will be overwritten 
	--&gt; why solution correct:
		1. mutual exclusion
		2. progress requirement satisfied
		3. bounded waiting requirement satisfied

	--&gt; peterson's solution = software based b/v no special support from OS or hardware instructions

<span id="6.4 Hardware support for synchronization-Memory Barriers"></span><strong id="Memory Barriers">Memory Barriers</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; mem model = how a comp arch determines what mem guarantees it will give to app
		1. strongly ordered = mod mem on 1 processor, shows all others
		2. weakly ordered = mod mem on 1 processor, not immediately visible to other processors
	--&gt; mem barriers = b/c all processors have diff mem model, use these to force mem mods to be vibile to all threads on other processors (works even w/ reordered instructions)

<span id="6.4 Hardware support for synchronization-Atomic variables"></span><strong id="Atomic variables">Atomic variables</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; atomic variable = lets you make atomic operations on basic data types like ints and bools 
	--&gt; help to ensure mutual exclusion with data race on 1 single variable (e.g. incrementing)
	--&gt; most sys support atomic vars  + atomic data types + atomic functions 
	--&gt; DO NOT SOLVE data race problem, only helps to mitigate it

<div id="6.5 Mutex Locks"><h3 id="6.5 Mutex Locks" class="header"><a href="#6.5 Mutex Locks">6.5 Mutex Locks</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	--&gt; hardware solution to critical section problem usually very complicated + hard for app devs to implement
	--&gt; instead: use higher level software tools
	--&gt; mutex lock = simple tool to protext critical section + prevent race conditions 
		--&gt; proccess needs to get lock b4 entering ciritcal section + release lock when exit critical section (acquire() and release())
	--&gt; use bool var "available," if available=true, then acquire() call succeeds 
	--&gt; order for using mutex locks:
		1. acquire()
		2. enter critical section
		3. release()
		4. back to remainder section 
	--&gt; lock contention
		1. contended = thread blocks while trying to acquire lock
		2. uncontended = thread getes the lock 
			--&gt; high contention (many threads want) and low contention
	--&gt; use spin locks if lock is held for less time than 2 context switches 
	--&gt; con: busy waiting (if lock is used, then processes waiting for lock have to keep calling acquire(), wasting CPU cycles)
		--&gt; spinlock: process is "spinning" while waiting for lock to be available 
			--&gt; pro: don't need context switch for process to wait on the spinlock + best used on multicore sys + short duration

<div id="6.6 Semaphores"><h3 id="6.6 Semaphores" class="header"><a href="#6.6 Semaphores">6.6 Semaphores</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	--&gt; semaphore = integer variable accessed thru only 2 standard atomic operations
		--&gt; wait() and signal() as atomic operations 
	--&gt; all mods to integer values of the sempahore in wait() + signal() operations needs to be executed atomically
		--&gt; means only 1 process can operate on the semaphore value at once
</pre>
<p>
<span id="6.6 Semaphores-Semaphore usage"></span><strong id="Semaphore usage">Semaphore usage</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; counting vs binary semaphores 
		--&gt; counting = unrestricted domain, control access to 1 resource w/ finite instances 
			--&gt; initialize to num of avail resources 
			--&gt; if process wants to use resource, it makes wait() operation on sempahore (Decrement count) 
			--&gt; when proess release resource, performs signal() --&gt; increment count
			--&gt; if count for semaphore = 0, all resources used 
		--&gt; binary = 0 or 1 (like mutex locks, used often instead of mutex locks)
	--&gt; solves sync problems
</pre>

<span id="6.6 Semaphores-Semaphore implementation"></span><strong id="Semaphore implementation">Semaphore implementation</strong>

<pre>
	--&gt; problem: processes busy waiting for lock to free up
	--&gt; solution: process suspend themselves while waiting for lock to open up
		--&gt; restart when another process executes "signal()"
