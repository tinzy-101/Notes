<ol>
<li>
evaluate infix expression 

<ul>
<li>
pretty much same algo as generating a postfix expression from infix

<li>
split string into a bunch of tokens (operands and operators) 

<ul>
<li>
good to surround operators with spaces when (split based on delimiters of white space) inputting

<li>
OR just check based on identity of token

</ul>
<li>
need operand and operator stack (2)

</ul>
</ol>
<div id="Queues"><h3 id="Queues" class="header"><a href="#Queues">Queues</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
queue = ordered entries where entries can only be inserted at one end (rear) and removed from other end (front) 

<ul>
<li>
FIFO

</ul>
<li>
application: figuring out whether string is a palindrome or not 

<ul>
<li>
take string apart char by char

<li>
use a stack and a queue to store chars

</ul>
<li>
monte carlo simulation: car wash 

<ul>
<li>
situation

<ul>
<li>
if wash car on fast, use a lot of soap and water, but get more customers

<li>
if wash car slower, use less soap and water, but get less waters

<li>
what's the ideal trade off? 

<li>
want to calculate the average wait tme for each car upon entering and upon leaving the carwash

</ul>
<li>
input: how much time to wash 1 car, probability that a new car arrives every sec/time frame, total time to simulate

<li>
output: number of customers services during time, average time customer waits in line during simulation

<li>
model: maintain a clock that moves 1 sec at a time, every sec, ask if there is another car coming in,

<ul>
<li>
maintain a queue of time stamps for each car (when they enter)

<li>
each car also maintains a waittime variable (difference between entering time and time when it leaves queue)

<li>
every second, decrease the time in a car wash for car in the car wash

<li>
every time car enters car wash (leaves queue), send its wait time to an averager, can do same for num cars entering

</ul>
<li>
implementation 

<ul>
<li>
create a class for bool_source (probability of new car showing up), averager, and washer (stores info abt the washer, how much time it has left washing)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
array implementation of queue 

<ul>
<li>
queue is a way to buffer some content --&gt; replace recursion algos with stack or queue (recursion usually easiest)

<li>
can use a dynamic or fixed size array

<li>
end of array is entrance, start of array is the first item in the queue

<li>
need first and last indieces + circular array 

<ul>
<li>
implement using modulo arithmetic

<li>
everytime you add, need to ask yourself what the next index should be

<li>
if newindex % capacity = 0, that means youve exceeded capacity and need to go to 0 (e.g. 5 % 5)

<li>
if 2 % 5, then still get 2 --&gt; constantly use moduluo to get new index

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
linked list implementation 

<ul>
<li>
maintain head and tail ptr, one end is entrance, and one end if exit (front)

<li>
head node = front of queue, tail noe = rear of queue

<li>
need copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor

</ul>
<li>
stl implementation of double ended queue (deque) 

<ul>
<li>
can enter or exit from front or back

<li>
want to merge benefits of linked list and array (pointer arithmetic)

<li>
allocate blocks of memory, e.g. 5 elements per block

<li>
each block is stored in a block pointer array (pointers to each element)

<li>
more efficient to allocate and deallocate a whole block of entries together rather than one by one 

</ul>
</ol>
