<pre>
	- have policy you create + how policy is implemented, started in 1990s
	- Principle of least privilege (hard to implement): 
	  	- have diff domains w/ diff access, and can get muddled
		- if file in d1 is r/w, but in d2 is read only, then you choose the lowest privilege to access file 
		- but what is needed is write access, what to do then?
	- grain = how deep u want to go into the particular object youre dealing with 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="Chapter 17: Protection-Protection Rings"></span><strong id="Protection Rings">Protection Rings</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- components of OS ordered by amt of privilege and protected from each other
	- e.g. kernel is surrounded by sys calls and user programs that protect it A
	- e.g. ARM CPU Architecture = layer OS, hypervisor, secure monitor around kernel, access w/ syscalls and kernel calls, abstract layer calls
</pre>
<p>
<span id="Chapter 17: Protection-Domains of Protection"></span><strong id="Domains of Protection">Domains of Protection</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- rings of protection separate functions into domains + order then w/ hierarchy
	- computer = processes + objects (ardware and software) 
	- can switch b/w domains 
	  
	 UNIX can switch domains based on groups users are in
	 	- e.g. access matrix: 
		  	- d1 can read file1, but can't see file2, can go to printer 
			- d2 can read and execute file1, can't go to printer 
		- access matrix is really big data structure, but not that much data in it 
			  
	static protection = being in a domain as a user
	dynamic protection = have different rights + can go to different domains 
		- problem: need to keep domain and privileges simple
		- gets more complicated as you make more rights, like copy files, control over domains 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="Chapter 17: Protection-Implementing Access Matrix"></span><strong id="Implementing Access Matrix">Implementing Access Matrix</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	1. capability list 
		- list of objects + all capabilities allowed with the object 
	2. access list 
		- list of domains 
	3. lock key 
		- compromise b/w access list and capability lists 
		- pass keys from domain to domain
		- now have another lock issue, need mutual exclusion 
	
	are tradeoffs on everything you implemented in your OS 
		- e.g. global table simple, large 
		  - hard to determine access rights for domain non localized 
		  - revocation capabilities sometimes inefficient
</pre>
<p>
<span id="Chapter 17: Protection-Revocation of Access Rights"></span><strong id="Revocation of Access Rights">Revocation of Access Rights</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- immediately revoke, or after some event?
	- selective vs general?
	- partial vs total revokation?
	- temp or permanent?
	
	If revoke something, need to reqacuisition if you need it  
		- back pointer = set of pointers from each object to all capabilities of that object
		- indireciton = capability points to gloal table entry which points to object
		- key = unique bits associated w/ capability, generated when capability created 
		  - will have master key 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="Chapter 17: Protection-Role Based Access Control"></span><strong id="Role Based Access Control">Role Based Access Control</strong> 
</p>
<pre>
	- set privileged roles, commonly used on systems
</pre>
<p>
<span id="Chapter 17: Protection-Mandatory Access COntrol (MAC)"></span><strong id="Mandatory Access COntrol (MAC)">Mandatory Access COntrol (MAC)</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- if sys says needs access, then using discretion, and want to be stronger 
	- some things even root user cannot access 
	- best to change root password in linux distro 
	- capability based systems not very easy to implement, like POSIX says to do
	
	Sandboxing: 
		- try things in a limited environment before you do for entire system 
	
	- can do code hashes w/ cypto signing for protection 
	- can do protection within code itself (e.g. java 2)
	- can check the stack
