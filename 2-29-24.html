<pre>
	1. fixed size partitions
	2. variable size partitions 
		3 mechanisms for putting programs in memory
		 	a. first fit (first one big enough for the program)
			b. best fit (sort holes smallest to largest)
			c. worst fit (sort holes largest to smallest, automatically in largest hold)
				- if put process in a hole, and still hole remaining, same hole num 
</pre>

<span id="Test 3 Review-Virtual Memory:"></span><strong id="Virtual Memory:">Virtual Memory:</strong>
</p>
<pre>
 	1. virtual format: segment / page / displacement
			- if page size = 4k (2^12), the size of the displacement = 12 bits
			- 32 bits-12 bits = 20 bits left
			- let num pages per segment = 10 bits, 2^10 = 1024 pages that can be put into a segment
			- leaves 10 bits for the segment, and can have 1000 segments inside program
			- entire address adds up to 4 gb
	2. dynamic address translation (DAT):
			- have 4 possible outcomes: 
				1. page is in mem, and get page address for it
				2. segment fault, because no pages in that segment are in mem (blank spot in segment map table)
				3. page fault, blank spot in page map table (page not in mem)
				4. invalid reference, page or segment does not exist (e.g. page 5 but pages only 0-3)
			- tables: 
			  	1. segment map table
				2. page map table (for each segment)
				3. page frames = real mem 
			- given virtual address, get real address by chasing thru tables 
			  	- in virtual address, given: page frame address + displacement 
	3. show how virtual storage gets converted to a real address 
			- whole point of virtual storage system is that not entire program is in mem at one time 
			- eventually, if you don't have enough real page frames for your program, will have to replace a page from some process or that process
	4. page replacement algos: 
			1. POO: principle of optimality 
					- replace page that's not going to be used furthest time in future 
			2. NUR: not used recently 
					- use 2 bits on each page frame: reference bit + modify bit
					- replace in this order: 00 01 10 11 
					  1. not referenced and not modified
					  2. not referenced but modified
					  3. referenced but no modified
					  4. referenced and modified 
					- periodically, all reference bits are reset to 0 
			3. LRU: least recently used
					- time stamp each reference
					- replace oldest referenced one
			4. FIFO 
					- time stamp when page placed into mem
					- replace oldest page 
			5. LFU: least frequently used 
					- use a count and replace page with least references
			6. MFU: most frequently used 
					- use a count and replace page with most references  
			7. ClockPolicy (2nd chance) 
					- round robin checking 1 reference bit
					- if bit = 1, reset the bit and move pointer to next block 
					- wants to find a 0 = has been referenced 
			8. working set 
					- give process starting num of frames
					- choose replacement within that working set 
					- if getting a lot of page faults, know that you need to increase working set

<span id="Test 3 Review-Page Replacement Example:"></span><strong id="Page Replacement Example:">Page Replacement Example:</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	Background: Process 'X' executing, last acces in page frame 004. X has 2 pages in mem and had a page fault. 
					OS needs to decide which page to replace for X's new page. 
					Unlike other "active" processes, process Z's state is suspended 
					Current time: 16:00
	1. FIFO = using "Entered Time"  
			- replace page frame 001 because time = 00:10, farthest from current time 16:00
	2. LRU = "Last Used" 
			- replace page frame 006 because oldest time used = 05:22 (doesn't matter if process Z is suspended or not)
	3. LFU = "Use Count" 
			- replace page frame 005 because lowest use count = 90 
	4. MFU = "Use Count" 
			- replace page frame 002 because highest use count = 340
	5. Clock Policy = "Clock Policy" 
			- page frame 005 is checked next = 1, so set to 0 and go to the next one
			- page frame 006 also = 1, so set to 0 and go to 001 (round robin)
			- all page frames 001 - 004 are = 1, so set to 0
			- therefore page frame 005 will be the first 0 that gets hit, and will be replaced 
	6. NUR = "Acc/Mod" 
			- replace page frame 006 because it has not been accessed or modified (00)
	7. Working Set Policy = look at which pages the process that needs a replacement has in their working set 
			- X needs a page replacement, so look at its working set
			- X working set = frame 002 + frame 004 
			- in instructions above: page frame 004 was JUST accessed, so don't replace 004 
			- only 1 other frame in X's working set, so have to replace 002

	1. 10 blocks
	2. file A starts at block 0, count the blocks by chasing, 0 points to 8, 8 points to 3, etc. until one of them points to NULL 
	3. count how many blocks (count up to number + NULL, e.g. 6: NULL = 1 block!)

<span id="Test 3 Review-Optional Problem"></span><strong id="Optional Problem">Optional Problem</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	1. assume multiprogramming: 1 cpu, 2 i/o processors (no contention on i/o)
	2. only 2 processes run simultaneously
	3. A: 10cpu, 7io, 5cpu
		B: 5cpu, 3io, 10 cpu 
	4. times out at 5 units (quantum) 
		- e.g. A will time out after 5 units, but B won't time out, can go straight to io
	5. no other processes will enter until both processes are finished 
	6. OS takes 2 units for any activity 
	
	1. A takes 5 cpu units, times out for 2 units
	2. start B, B requests service + start io for 3 io units
	3. after starting B's i/o, A will only get 2 units
	4. b gets cpu for 5 units, times out, and gets service request compeltion interrupt, so needs another unit to handle it 
	5. B completes, OS comes in, finishes A
	
	1. os starts things up, fcfs so a before b processed
	2. last pulse it does, start a, a starts at pulse 3 with 1-5 cycles, but quantum is 5, so there is timeout
	3. os comes in for 2 units, and will take a off executin, and put it on ready lsit behind b
	4. starts b for 1-5
	5. go to os, os sets up b for i/o, starts io for 3, interrupt on the vertical bar (tildes then vertical bar)
	6. 	
	7. can't start a on the same cycle of the OS, OS can then start up A again 
	8. A still needs remaining 5 quantums
