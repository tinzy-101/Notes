Finally, the long awaited hike! Unfortunately Laryssa wasn't feeling up to wake up so early, I ended up waking up at 6am
to go there by myself. 영애이모 was so sweet, she woke up to make me breakfast and I had seaweed soup. So grateful I 
didn't have to go to church, but poor sophie lol. On the way out, I stopped by the local GS25 and got the cheapest kimbap
+ a really nice 1+1 chocolate cookie thing, so yummy. 

Then I took the train to 아차산역, and had to make a tranfer. On the second (5th) line, I got on and sat down on one of
the 3 seats on the left end of the car. Some old ladies came in and sat across from me, and I thought nothing of it.
After a few stops, out of the corner of my eye, I saw this man stick his arm out and snap continuously. I lowk thought
that was really creepy and thought he wasn't talking to me and ignored it for a while. After a while, he started saying
"hey, hey" kinda quietly, and I finally looked up. He kept motioning upwards, and I finally saw that the seats I was 
sitting on was reserved for old people. Thankfully the train wasn't full, but it was still awk as hell. The man motioned
me to sit next to him on the opposite side, so I quickly went and sat a few seats away. 
Then, the man leaned over to me, and told he he was just worried I didn't know. He was slouched in the chair and man
spreading like crazy. He was wearning some gold blingy rings, and looked like he was in his 20s, very young and ok 
looking. He started asking me in english where I was from, how long, what I was doing there. Was a pretty chill 
conversation, until he started asking about where I was living. He said a bunch of foreigners living in Hongdae and
Itaewon, and it just seemed so slimy. I just kept telling him I lived in Seoul, and he eventually got the hint, and 
left me alone. It was weird tho, cause he kept smirking. Creepy, glad I didn't tell him where I was. 

Was a little shaken and embarassed when I started the hike, but soon felt a lot better. I immediately saw a lot of 
hikers, and even though the directions I found online were SUPER accurate, it was still helpful to follow the hikers lol.
I eventaully made it to the stairs. 

I was pretty much the only foreigner there, and kept getting stares. There were tons of old ladies and men walking solo,
and barefoot which was pretty impressive. The mountain was insanely beautiful, very rocky with tons of stairs, but
also some parts that looked like forests back in the US. The humidity was no joke though; my entire back was soaked 
within an hour, it was terrible. 

On the way up, I passed by the temple and some other landmarks I was supposed to see, but completely missed the first
few forts and only saw the 4th and biggest one. I decided to take random detours and didn't really know where I was 
going, just kinda followed the flow of the people, or wherever I wanted to go lol. I made it up to the summit of 아차산
pretty quickly and it was really nice. The views of Seoul and 한강 were actually insane, if not super smoggy. I also
saw this dead baby deer on the trail. People were so respectful of it, and someone even covered it up with 2 bandanas.
I don't think I would see that in the US, just really heartwarming. 

The route I ended up taking led me across most of the park. I summited 아차산, but somehow missed 영마산 (mainly bc
I didn't bother to read signs and just kept moving), and eventually made it to the 우지 mountain (not sure if that 
name is right), but it was pretty awesome. As I was descending 영마산, there were tons of stairs and people looked 
so miserable going up lol. In the 2nd half of the hike, past 영마산, the scenery changed a lot and it was more grassy.

Here I saw a ton of graves, and also some cute wildlife, like this massive cricket and pink mushroom!

I also passed by this old man in blue on my way down, and stood aside to let him pass and he said thanks in korean. I
eventually turned back after I hit a road (after about 4.5 mi), and I ran into the man again going the opposite 
direction, and we smiled at each other. Actually the first person to not ignore me on the trail, and it felt so 
heartwarming haha. 
It was also at this point where I kept seeing this old man in neon orange. I passed him, then he passed me. On my way
back towards 영마산, I kept going back and forth because I was a bit lost (I wonder why lol....), and kept running into
him. When I was resting at the 영마산 peak that I finally found after reading a sign on the way back, and making a detour
to see it, I saw him going up. I descended, but realized I descending too far, and had to hike back up to go down the
right trail to get back to 아차산. Thank god kakao maps location marker works without a signal, so i could see where
I was on the mountain. Anyways, ask I was heading back up, i passed by the man AGAIN. This time, he stopped, pulled out
his headphones, and started saying something to me in korean, and I guess he was saying he's so surprised to keep 
seeing me lol, but who knows. It was such a funny encounter, and he left right after saying that. 

The rest of the hike down was pretty chill once I found the right trail. The wind felt nice, and I went down a different
trail than I came up, which was a lot more civilized with more families. At the bottom-ish, there was another 
shoe-blowing thingy like in 설숲. Also, along the trail, there were tons of emergency call buttons, crazy how 
civilized it is, makes me wonder what bukhansan will look like. There was also this open hose a little ways down
with constantly flowing fresh water, and it felt so nice to splash on my face. 

Eventaully, I descended all the way and was greeted by real civilization and a bus. I found this photo booth thingy, 
similar to the one at the DMZ, and was able to take a very grainy photo to commemorate the hike, it was so fun haha,
and people were nice enough to stay out of the way to let me get the picture. Successful first solo hike, 10.5 mi :D

After the picture, I texted it to my korean number and was able to navigate back to 아차산역 and head home. I found this
really nice thin jacket for 15k won, and got to wear it home, I got home at 1ish, and surprisingly, was all alone. 
Sophie and the host fam didn't get home til about 3:15 lol, and were there since 11:50. Apparently it was the church's
44th anniversary, and they had tons of stuff. And people were so glad to see Sophie and tried to convert her, so scary
yet so funny lol. 

At 4:30, 영애이모, 꿀떡, Sophie and I drove up to 남산 to take a walk. It was going to rain at 6pm, so we decided to eat
first. The bibimbap restaurant 영애이모 wanted to go to wouldn't let 꿀떡 in, and 영애이모 was kinda mad, first time I've
seen that. But we were able to find another restaurant just from these hawkers on the street. They were actually doing
the most for customer service though, directing cars, and holding umbrellas up when it was raining. Super kind people.
I got the tonkatsu, and it was so delicious, and there was free cream soup too. It started raining while we were eating, 
and was super pretty and a really nice 분위기. After the dinner, we got babbingsu!! It was so amazing, with ice cream,
a layer of red bean, ice, soy bean power, gummies, and milk at the bottom. One of the best deserts I've had to date. 

After the meal, we just drove home cause it was raining so hard. Kinda ironic how we drove up to 남산 just to eat...
apprently 남산 is known for their tonkatsu, so that's a win.

After that, we went shopping with 꿀떡 while she sat in the basket, it was really cute haha. 
Then we came home and slept. Really exciting yet relaxing day, was actually really nice to have some chill time
alone while hiking.
