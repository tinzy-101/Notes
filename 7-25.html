Today in class we did a bunch of OPI practice, feeling pretty nervous for the actual OPI we're gonna have, especially
because we only have 4 classes left omg. During break teacher was talking to Jenny again, probably about our class being
disruptive, problably our table too. hopefully not me, at least ive been telling kunk to shut up in class lol. class
didn't feel as long because of the OPI practice tho, so that was good. I also tried the matcha latte from the cafe next
to the 편의점 for the first time and it was surprisingly good and big for being 3.5k won, like in the US that would
easily be $7 ong. it didnt taste that strongly of matcha tho, which isn't my favorite. lowk wanna try another latte
tomorrow, but we'll see. at least i didn't get snacks today lol
Today didn't feel like a 식당 kinda day so we all went to the 평의점 in the humanities building. I got the 참치김치 and 갈비 onigiri and the kimchi was surprisinly good, and 100 won less than the tuna mayo one! i think kimchi's actually
reallys starting to grow on me, especially when its not being eaten alone, super surprising because I thought Id only 
ever tolerate it and not actually enjoy eating it...definitely need to try some recipes when i get some, especially with 
tuna cause its so good! i also tried some pizza chip that salene got and it was pretty bomb! lowk wanna get some for
myself
AFter we finished our lunch, we went to get more matcha kicker bars cause theyre so damn good. we also went to some 
random room int he internationl building in order to have a talk with jennie about us being too disruptive in class,
and also the baeball game on saturday being cancelled, apparently we're going to some traditional nonverbal play instead
which everyone is not excited about (except for sophia and jolie)......hopefully it'll be fun?? its with out supporters
too...
also, during that time the floodgates opened about the supporters. aparently lorana nd blessings' supporter took a taxi
and told them to ride the bus or walk, or split the cost of the taxi. kaila and i also told jennie about how they said
it was the last time they would be buying us bread....jennie had to talk to each supporter individually, and yongun 
was complaining saying that we were all asking for an individual bread, and jennie apparently said that that was too 
much to ask for and that we had to share the bread....awkward as hell considering all the ornate things that other 
supporters are doing for their students, but honestly not a big deal...im just whining lol after we went to the 
university cafe, jennie and soomin were there
and they literally offered to buy us food, and i felt kinda bad so i didnt get anything. yongun also kept asking me 
what i wanted to eat so that was awkward, esp since she was just doing that bc jennie and soomin were there.
I did get a blueberry yogurt smoothie tho and that was really good! 
yeun was also there and she was super chill, gave us some hi-chew like lychee candies. she tutored me, kaila, and alex
again today and we did more listening and writing practice with the grammar which was honestly super helpful.
at 5 me, salene, laryssa, ivy, and elena went to 동묘시장 which was honestly a bit of a let down. they found their stussy
but honeslty 25k was too much for me. a lot of it was all fancy brands like nike, designer, etc and way overpriced, 
especially for being used clothes. lots of trinkets too but it was all really dirty and i felt so grimy touching the 
stuff. but, i did cop some merrel shirts for 5k won each, so that was a win. more hiking and taekwondo shirts wahoo!
i kept looking for street food but their was none....i ended up leaving at around 7 to get home which the rest of them 
went out to each NK naengmyeon which is super famous apprently. 
at home we ate without kim bc he was eating with the company, and it was chill. she made a kimchi and fish jim which was
pretty good, fish was a lil too fishy for me tho. there was also a side of bean sprouts, fresh radish and gochugaru, 
and really sweet pumpkin soup. we made lettuce wraps and it was delicious hehe. also really enjoyed the kimchi in the 
wrap, so good. 이모 kept telling us that the kimchi tastes better if it stays long so she riped them into noodle-like
strands which was super interesting. as always, we ended dinner with an ice cream, and i tried the chestnut cake 
sandwich thingy and it was super good!
</p>

<p>
we ended the night there and i did a whole bunch of scrolling........oof oof not good but at least im keeping up with 
these diary entries?? hehe will be fun to read back on...just not looking forward to actually sorting and putting all
the pictures in....but it'll be worth it! 할수있어! 
Here's to hoping saturday with the supporters go well, especially after how awkward it was today. yongun as usual 
didn't really talk to me...
