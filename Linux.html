<div id="Keyboard Stuff-An XKB Adventure:"><h5 id="An XKB Adventure:" class="header"><a href="#Keyboard Stuff-An XKB Adventure:">An XKB Adventure:</a></h5></div>
<pre>
	1. xkb = x keyboard extension, can be configured to use multiple keyboard layouts
	2. go to /usr/share/X11/xkb to see all directories
		a. base.lst in rules directory has all the possible configurations (langugages supported)
		b. to configure new language, need to go to /usr/share/locale
	3. go to symbols directory to see names of different symbols for each supported language 
	4. go to evdev file in keycodes directory to see the keycodes associated with each key on keyboard (can also run xev in terminal to find keycodes and associated hex)
	5. use setxkbmap to change configurations
		a. general format (in terminal or in wm config file): 
				setxkbmap [-model xkb_model] [-layout xkb_layout] [-variant xkb_variant] [-option xkb_options]
				-supported layouts, variants, and options in base.lst
			sample format:
				setxkbmap -model pc104 -layout cz,us -variant ,dvorak -option grp:win_space_toggle
		b. sample format: sets keyboard format to czech and us, no variant on czech keyboard but us isin the dvorak layout, and you can toggle different keyboard layouts using window + space 
	6. did not work for me! ended up using ibus :')
	7. setxkbmap -print -verbose 10 (in terminal)
		a. prints current xkbmap settings 

compose keys:
	1. can set a &lt;Multi_key&gt; that when pressed + two more keys will print special character
	2. go to /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8 (if using en_US.UTF-8) as your locale
	3. Compose file shows preconfigured compose key combos
	4. to configure your own combos: create ~/.XCompose file
		a.	include "%L"
			&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;g&gt; &lt;a&gt; : "α"
			&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;g&gt; &lt;b&gt; : "β"
			&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;g&gt; &lt;g&gt; : "γ" 
		b. include "%L" includes current Compose file
		c. press multikey + g + a = get alpha character
	5. configuring multikey
		a. go to ~/.Xmodmap (~/.Xinitrc might also work depending on system)
		b. keycode 66 = Multi_key
			clear lock
			-find keycode for desired key on your keyboard using xim (66 = caps)
			-idk what clear lock does, but it works
		c. xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap to reload and set new multikey
		d. for i3: put &lt;exec --nostartup-id "xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap"&gt; in config file so mapping is permanent
		d. use &lt;xmodmap -pk | grep Multi_key&gt; to seewhich keys you've configured as multi
		e. CANNOT remove multikeys just by deleting fom xmodmap file, need to manually reconfigure
			-e.g. get caps back: keycode 66 = Caps_Lock (check names in xkb rules)
				--&gt; can't find name in xkb rules?
				--&gt; go to /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h
				--&gt; ignore XK_ in front of names, can use names in .Xmodmap file
			-or else will end up with TWO multikeys
	6. getting gtk to recognize compose keys (XIM is NOT supported by default)
		a. go to /etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
		b. add &lt;GTK_IM_MODULE=xim&gt; and &lt;XMODIFIERS="@im=none"&gt;
	7. why tho?
		a. custom keyboard layout! i couldn't get hangul working with setxkbmap (other keyboards, like thai and russian cyrillic worked)
		b. can map every hangul component to key combo with compose key (problem is, they don't combine into character blocks like supposed to)
		c. conclusion: useless for hangul, but probably useful for other languages that don't need to combine components to form character blocks, like cyrillic, latin, or hebrew)
		

understanding keycodes (found in xkb):
	1. keys (e.g. &lt;AD01&gt;)
		-A = alphanumeric (KP = keypad, FN = function)
		-D = the row (A = keyboard row, count up to 4th row of alphanumeric block is D)
		-01 = the column (left to right, ignoring special keys like tab/caps)
