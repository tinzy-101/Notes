<p>
<span id="12.1 Overview-Introduction"></span><strong id="Introduction">Introduction</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- main jobs of computer: i/o and computing 
	- OS needs to manage and control io operations + devices 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.1 Overview-Overview"></span><strong id="Overview">Overview</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- need to control devices connected to computers + eed different methods b/w there are so many diff devices 
	- trend: more standardiation of hardware + software interfaces BUT also more variety of io devices 
	  - device drivers = uniform device access interface to io subsystems 
</pre>

<div id="12.2 io hardware"><h3 id="12.2 io hardware" class="header"><a href="#12.2 io hardware">12.2 io hardware</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	- device comm with computer system by sending signals over cable or thru air
	  - use connection point = port
	  - use bus = set of wires + rigid protocol to define messages that can be sent on wires 
		- use controller = collectionf of electronics to help operate port, bus, or device 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.2 io hardware-Memory mapped I/O"></span><strong id="Memory mapped I/O">Memory mapped I/O</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- controller accesses register for data + control signals
	- processor reads/write bit patterns in register to comm with controller 
	- if recieve io instruction, transfer over bus to registers
	OR mem mapped io: 
	- device control registers mapped into address space of processor + CPU execs io requests
	
	The registers:
		1. data in: read by host to get input
		2. data out: written by host to send output
		3. status: bits can be read by host, indicate states
		4. control: written by host to start a command or change mode of device 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.2 io hardware-Polling"></span><strong id="Polling">Polling</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- handshaking = protocol for host and controller comm 
	  - basically check if each other are busy by setting bits, and controller can read command register when host lets it
	 
	 - busy waiting = polling: reading status register over and over until busy bit is not set 
		- would rather have a device use an interrupt to tell CPU it is ready 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.2 io hardware-Direct Memory Access"></span><strong id="Direct Memory Access">Direct Memory Access</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- direct memory access (DMA) controller = spcialy purpose processor to handle large requests
	- device controller + DMA controller need to communicate over wires of bus 
	  	- DMA will interrupt CPU once it finishes its transfer 
		- steald mem access cycles from main CPU (temp blocks CPU)
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.2 io hardware-I/O Hardware summary"></span><strong id="I/O Hardware summary">I/O Hardware summary</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- bus
	- controller
	- i/o port and registers
	- handshaking b/w host and dev controller
	- exec of handshaking in polling loop via interrupts
	- offload work to DMA for alrge transfer 
</pre>

<pre>
	- need structure + interface for OS so that i/o devices can be treated standardly 
	- device driver layer = hides differences b/w dev controlelrs from i/o subsystems of kernel 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.3 Application I/O interface-Block and character devices"></span><strong id="Block and character devices">Block and character devices</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- block device interface = helps to access disk drives + other block-oriented devices 
	- needs to recognize read(), write(), seek() commands 
	- can use mem mapped file access on top of block device drivers 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.3 Application I/O interface-Network devices"></span><strong id="Network devices">Network devices</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- network socket interface = lets apps connect to remote sockets thru local sockets
		- send packets to communicate 
	- used for disks 
	- no polling or busy waiting 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.3 Application I/O interface-Clocks and timers"></span><strong id="Clocks and timers">Clocks and timers</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- computers have hardware clocks: 
	  1. give current time
	  2. give elapsed time
	  3. set a timer to trigger an operation at time T (e.g. interrupts) 
	- used for a variety of purposes
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.3 Application I/O interface-Nonblocking and async IO"></span><strong id="Nonblocking and async IO">Nonblocking and async IO</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- blocking syscall = exec of calling thread is suspended, and moved to wait queue 
	  - easier to write than non blocking
	 - nonblocking i/o = required by some user level processes
	  - can just async syscalls and commands 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.3 Application I/O interface-Vectored I/O"></span><strong id="Vectored I/O">Vectored I/O</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- vectored i/o = one syscall can perform multiple i/o operations with many locations 
	- use multiple buffers and transfer their contents using 1 syscall, so don't need context switch
</pre>


<div id="12.7 Kernel I/O subsystem"><h3 id="12.7 Kernel I/O subsystem" class="header"><a href="#12.7 Kernel I/O subsystem">12.7 Kernel I/O subsystem</a></h3></div>
<p>
<span id="12.7 Kernel I/O subsystem-I/O scheduling"></span><strong id="I/O scheduling">I/O scheduling</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- use wait queues for each device + I/O scheduler rearranges them in queue to improve efficiency
	- sometimes device status table attached to wait queue, w/ entries to show address, type, state of device 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.7 Kernel I/O subsystem-Buffering"></span><strong id="Buffering">Buffering</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	Reasons to use:
		1. help w/ speed mismatch w/ producer and consumer
		2. adaptations for device w/ different data transfer sizes
		3. support copy semantics for app i/o
			- version of data written to disk is guaranteed to be version in syscall
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.7 Kernel I/O subsystem-Caching"></span><strong id="Caching">Caching</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- cache = region of fast mem w/ copies of data 
	- hold copies of currently exec instructions
	- improve i/o efficiency
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.7 Kernel I/O subsystem-Spooling and device reservation"></span><strong id="Spooling and device reservation">Spooling and device reservation</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- spool =  buffer w/ output for device 
	  - e.g. OS will intercept output for printer and put it in spoo 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.7 Kernel I/O subsystem-Error handling"></span><strong id="Error handling">Error handling</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- i/o transfers + devices can fail for transient and permanent reasons, and OS needs to compensate
	- i/o dev returns one bit of info about status of call
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.7 Kernel I/O subsystem-I/O protection"></span><strong id="I/O protection">I/O protection</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- all i/o instructions = privileges, users have to do thru OS
	- mem mapped and i/o port locations need to be protected form user 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.7 Kernel I/O subsystem-Kernel data structures"></span><strong id="Kernel data structures">Kernel data structures</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- kernel needs to keep tarck of use of i/o components using kernel data structures  
</pre>
<p>
<span id="12.7 Kernel I/O subsystem-Power management"></span><strong id="Power management">Power management</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- OS helps with power use + head gen + cooling 
	  - CPU cores suspended by dont need them

<div id="12.5 Transforming I/O requests to hardware operations"><h3 id="12.5 Transforming I/O requests to hardware operations" class="header"><a href="#12.5 Transforming I/O requests to hardware operations">12.5 Transforming I/O requests to hardware operations</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	- how does OS connect app request to set of network wire or to specific disk sector? 
	- e.g. in UNIX, device names = regular fs name space, no separation in file path for device name 
	  - use mount table to associate path iwth device name 
	- modern OS: add new devices and drivers into computer w/o recompiling the kernel 
	  - dynamic loading!! (more compilcated than static loading) 
	
	I/O Request Life Cycle
		1. I/O request made thru syscall, kernel I/O subsystem checks if can satisfy (e.g. read request if data alr in buffer, don't need to call an i/o device for that)
		2. if can satisfy, proces the data to return to caller, and return from syscall. if not, send request to proper device driver.
		3. device driver processes request, send commands to device controller
		4. controller completes i/o, causes interrupt
		5. interrupt handled, data now in buffers, reset i/o device, and return from syscall
</pre>


<div id="12.6 Streams"><h3 id="12.6 Streams" class="header"><a href="#12.6 Streams">12.6 Streams</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	- many UNIX systems havev STREAMS = app can assemble pipelines of driver code dynamically
	- stream head = interface w/ user process
	- driver end = control device
	- stream modules = b/w stream head and driver end  
	- all parts of stream have read/write queue, and use message passing b/w queues 
	  - user: write() or putmsg() syscall
	- pro: framemwork with modular + incremental way of writing device drivers + network protocols
		- async
		- can use modules on diff devices 
</pre>


<div id="12.7 Performance"><h3 id="12.7 Performance" class="header"><a href="#12.7 Performance">12.7 Performance</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	- i/o puts high demand on OS: interrupt handling, loading mem bus, many context switches
	- front-end processors = good for terminal i/o to help CPU 
	  - e.g. terminal concentrator = multiplex traffic from 100s of remote terminals into 1 port 
	  - e.g. I/O channel = dedicated CPU in mainframes/high end systems to help offload I/O work 
	
	How to make I/O more efficient:
		1. less context switches
		2. data is copied in mem less
		3. less interrupts (use large transfer + smart controllers + polling)
		4. increase concurrency
		5. move processing primitives into hardware 
			- things are faster in hardware
		6. balance cpu + mem subsystem bus + i/o performance 
	
	Where I/O should be implemented: 
		1. App level 
			- pro: app code is flexible, and if app code crashes, whole sys won't crash + don't need to reload drivers after every change to code
			- con: inefficient, context switching overhead + can't use internal kernal data structures (threads, locking)
		2. Hardware level 
			- pro: best performance
			- con: hard to fix bugs, more dev time, less flexibility
			- implement in device or in device controller
