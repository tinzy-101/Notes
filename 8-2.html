I ended up sleeping in a bra cause it was just too damn hot in the room, and also just on the floor cause it was cooler
there. i was the first to wake up, took a wee, and came back at 9:20 to wake everyone else up. we got ready, i shared 
my toiletry bag with ivyssi, and then we all went off to breakfast which was in the pavilion across from the rooms. it
was so freaking hot there too, and none of us were really hungry either, tho we still ate. it was buffest style, and i 
got some really yummy quail egs and stir fried meat (pork), very delicious, jsut wihs i had more of an appetite. 
</p>

<p>
after breakfast we went to go pack up our rooms and we left so much trash oof, the trahs can was literally overflowing.
we packed up, brought our stuff down (a lot of our shower clothes were still went from last night, unfortunate. we
then went to the same breakfast place to get ready for a tea class, then jennie told us that the tea class was cancelled
bc the teacher was in a car accident on the way here, she said it so nonchalantly too omg, at least shes ok tho.
</p>

<p>
so we just went to our first location, which was kinda similar to yesterday; it was a study ground for sholars. at least
at this place there were parasols u could borrow, we all got the purple ones and it was so cute, and make for good photos
. we were by a reservoir with a temple/island in the middle, and it was so tempting to go in for a dip. this place
was a lot nicer than yesterdays bc it was so much more vibrant. we didnt explore much this time, we just chilled in the 
room with a fan and talked to jennie and kyle about how they get paid, which was fun. we also planned with jennie all
the things we're gonna do together on sunday hehe, so freaking exciting, but its also gonna be a chore to get everything
done. 
</p>

<p>
after time was up, we walked back to the bus, and started driving. we were trying to go to a hanok village, but as we
were driving up, there was a really narrow area, and our driver literally hit the freaking wall lol, so we had to back
it up. it was so ironic cause there was a 위험 sign right next to us as we backed up lol. 
</p>

<p>
after we backed up, we decided to just go to lunch, which was this massive really yummy fried fish. the side dishes
were also really yummy, there was so mushroom, yummy potato and fish cakes, and other fish ones that were not so good.
i ended up sitting next to alex, and we talked about all the things we're looking forward to and dreading about returning
home, which was pretty refreshing. she also pretty much only ate rice, which was really sad; appreantly she hates fish.
</p>

<p>
after lunch, we had some free time, so we hiked up this hill to go to a self serve cafe which was really cool! i got a 
chocolate peanut drumstick which absolutely hit the spot. also tried tanghulu muscat grapes which were icy and ok,
ivy then tried to get a drink from the machine, but along with ice it spit out a bunch of water, which she dumped out. 
only when she got the rest of the drink did she realize that the rest was only syrup and that the water was necessary
to water it down LOL, so the drink was very grape. the TV that was playing in the background was also kinda insane lol,
there were so many music videos that looked so high yet low budget at the same time. production quality was insanely 
high for how bad the music was oml. there was 1 music video, ironically, where i kinda liked the song, but the acting
was actually terrible. it was about this man losing his mother, but his mother looked young enough to be his wife, and
when they did flashbacks, they didnt even bother to try to make the mom look younger, it was also weird as hell. the 
ending scene was hilarious, the only time he starts crying is when he opens up the fridge and sees that its empty
cause his mom cant cook for him anymore, like ok many baby.
</p>

<p>
then we went back to the bus and got on the road, me and larry sat together again. we spent a good chunk of time talking
about anime and her cheerleading show. we talked about the live action of homunculus which i really freaking have to 
watch and also about some of my favorite twilight zone episodes (civil war walking down the road, and walking down the
road to go back in time). yesterday we also watched haikyuu together, which larry has seen like 9 times at this point 
lmao, its actually scary how feral she goes for them (esp for the gray striped hair boy). after we yapped for a bit
i started reading Not Your Typical Reincarnation Story, which so so freaking good, and id occasionally tap her to read 
some really cute blushing scenes. all of a sudden, on ep 20, the female lead literally goes to the male leads room to
kiss him on the forhead, and he literally grabs her and they do the deed, it was wild lmao, and me and larry ate that up
it was surprisingly spicy for a webtoon. we went "oh my gawd" for every scene lmao, we were so loud but it was wild haha
</p>

<p>
then we arrived at a rest stop, where we all bigbacked. i got the sotteoksotteok (good but not hot enough), larry got
the potato corn dog, and then i went to 편위점 to get 4 packs of the korean pretzel+sugar combo (so freakin yummy),
and also mushrooms. we were truly big backing it up lol, but so freaking worth it to snack on. we left a lil late and
salene had bought me and larry hotteok, it was so freaking yummy, way better than the one he had with imo cause it was
actually made of tteok. the sugar inside was a bit too much sometimes tho, and me and larry both got it on our shirts.
after that, we had 2 bags of chips gifted from ruby, and i had my mushroms, so delish, but i was so freaking full.
then i passed out for a bit until we arrived back. we were pretty late cause of so muhc traffic.
</p>

<p>
also, at the rest stop 이모 randomly texted us that we're going to see a movie tonight, like WTF bro. we had to rush to 
get home once we got back bc the movie was starting at 7pm, and we got back at like 6:50 lol, so we couldnt even go
home, 이모 was just waiting for us outside the apartment with her car. we drove there pretty quickly, but i was super
exchausted at this point omg. we went to go sign in, and usrprisngly i understood most of the paper hehe, except how
we heard about the event. it was free at a community center near hanyang and there was popcorn and this nice citrusy
juice too. it was madacascar in korean, but 이모 didnt realize it was a kids movie so that was really funny LOL, she was
so surprised when she saw that it was animated. we got an hour and a half in, then she noticed i was nodded off, and said
we should go home cause we were tired, but sophie kept saying she was fine, which made it awkward. also i found out she
didnt end up showering yesterday, which explains some stench. i went into the bathroom after her and it was actually
unbearable omg. she also made kimchi kimbap, sandwiches, peaches, and cucumbers for us to eat on the way cause she was 
worried about us being hungry, but that was so freaking wholesome and nice of her, we were both too full to eat tho 
unofortunately.
</p>

<p>
we went home and got there at the same time as kim. so we rolled down the window and talked to him, she kept talking to 
him but he just kept ignoring her which was horrible. while we were stopped, a car was rolling in behind us, and the 1st
word he says to her in this whoel convo is to yell at her to get out of the way so the other car can pass...like god 
fucking damn...no respect whatsoever. we went up together, and we 3 had dinner together (i thought we already ate) but 
the dubu kimchi jjigae was really good, so was the 고구마 stem side dish. sophie actually started crying during dinner
cause she was gonna miss imo so much :(
</p>

<p>
after dinner, sophie and i finished packing up and brought our luggage down, it was so surrealy and really sad to think
that we're actually movin out tomorrow....still so many things we havent done together, like cooking chinese food for 
them, makes me regret some things, but it was still a really good time. this just means that we def have to come back
to make green onion pancakes haha. this time when we brought our luggage down it actually all fit in the trunk, so yay!
</p>

<p>
we went back up and watched olympic archery until 12pm, and saw korean win gold against italy!!! 이모 taught us this 
little chant, "대한미국 clapclap clapclapclap" it was super fun and we kept doing it which scared 꿀떡 a lil bit cause 
she kept shivered and moving around our laps lol.
</p>

<p>
after that we went to sleep...last night in this house. sophie and i wrote up letters to 김선생님하고 이모, and it was
really hard to reflect on everything, and i feel like i didnt write enough. im gonna take one last look at the night view
for the last time, at least for a while, and go to sleep.
</p>

<p>
안녕히 줌을새요~ :')
