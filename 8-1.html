Day of the trip! actually super exciting, it was funny cause kim and 이모 actually saw us out the door this time, they
mustve been a bit worried. 이모 also gave me a bunhc of bandaids and medicine to put onto my cut. we got to the meet up
spot pretty early and just yapped with the bigbacks. ruby, elena, and simone were talking to a bus driver who seemed ok
but then he took a selfie with them which was pretty weird. larry and i sat together and we yapped for most of the ride
</p>

<p>
the first place we went to was this temple-liek place where scholars used to study. the ppl there opened up a balcony 
area for us that had only last been opened for the korean president, so we got lucky! it was so freaking hot so we 
all just gathered by the fan, but then went over to the special balcony to see the special flowers and hear the old men
talk about it. they wanted to post us all over, it was kinda weird. but all the colors and mountains were so vibrant it
was amazing.
</p>

<p>
we also went to this rest stop that had so much food, i got this pack of crackers + milkis drink but for kids with jennie
and kyle, it was very yummy. we also got fries from lotteria, also bomb hehe.
</p>

<p>
then we went to this hanok village thing and were give 1.5hrs to wander around, it was so freaking hot tho, so me and 
izzy went ahead while salene, larry, and ivy stayed behind in an AC cafe with jennie and kyle. we went to this massive
tree where people were writing their wishes on, which we did too. then we walked fruther, found this ACed museum which
was so freaking nice, then went and found some swings to go on hehe. it was hard to get momentum but so freaking fun
we then went to the river (wanted to dip our feet in), but didnt have enough time and there was some sort of construction
going on too. we were also out of time lol. on the walk there was also this massive pond with so many lily pads and white
lotuses, it was so amazingly beautiful. i wish we couldve enjoyed it more, but honestly it was just so unbearably hot,
like definitely worse than seoul.
</p>

<p>
then we went to lunch, took off our shoes, and had this large communal platter of chicken, japchae, 감자, and it was so
so so delicious, with soy sauce marinade. the banchan was also really good, i absolutely devoured. after that i dont 
really remember what we did, but i did pass out on the bus. i think we actually went to the hanoks after lunch lol, so 
oops. 
</p>

<p>
we then went to this dinner spot that was pretty far away, like an hour. we got there and sat down on the floor, and 
bibimbap with fish (there was a lot of fish on this trip), which was pretty good. there was also some cheon that was 
yummy. for some reason so many people were avoided the fish and called it mystery meat, but i thought it actually
tasted pretty good ngl. me and larryssa started yapping while the others were in the bathroom, and we layed down and 
could feel ourselves going up and down as we laughed. we started talking about all the new mannerisms we learned here
like the finger "um acktually" "dookie" "devious" LOL and thats how we found out we have the same laugh. we'd start 
laughing, realize at the same time our laugh was the same, then it would get higher pitch it was so funny, cause that
just made us laugh harder. we also did a friend snoopy with ivy, izzie, and salene which was so cute hehe.
</p>

<p>
after dinner we walked to the nearby bridge which was so breautiful during sunset. we took so many groups pics lol,
with jennie and kyle too. it was actually such a vibe, even tho i felt a wee bit stinky. salene gave us some sprits of
her 10k artbox perfume (COP) so it was okie. i loved watching all the couples go by in the boats on the river. also, this
korean couple came up to me and asked me to take photos for them, and even directed me on how to stand and hold the phone
(they wanted a high ass angle LOL), ALL IN KOREAN, WHICH I UNDERSTOOD it was really freaking cool hehe. 
</p>

<p>
after that, we drove a short bit to a supermarket, where jennie and kyle told us we could each buy 1 snack...no money 
limit except "be reasonable" and ofc we went crazy LOL, it was really fun. i got the fish ice cream with red bean and 
tteok, ivy got the seventeen brand mogu mogu (peach), izzie bought muscat grapes, salene got pineapple, and laryssa 
got donuts, which we feasted on in the bus and in our hanok room. the cart that jennie and kyle were pushing looked
so insane lol, and all the regular gorery shoppers were so confused LOL. i also found some of the almonds and blueberry
pocky to take home! so yumyum. 
</p>

<p>
we got back to the bus and feasted on the melting fish ice cream, and were so hyper afterwards, we couldnt stop laughing
esp since the lights were turned off hehe. it was such a vibe. 
</p>

<p>
we got to the hanoks pretty quickly, and bc they had to suddenly reorganize the rooms, we got first pick of a 5 person 
room which was awesome. the room was jsut big enough for sleeping but perfect for us. we got in, and accidently started
putting the winter blankets out LOL, and the the owner came to tell us off lol. after we set up the right blankets, we 
went to go shower. larry and i were about to raw dog it then realized it would be awk with others having clothes on,
we all put on swimsuits. me and ivy were matching hehe, and i just had to wear underwear on the bottom. we walked in the
dark, and got to a room with 3 shower heads (1 was broken tho), and larry and i jsut decied to go topless to get a nice
deep clean. the bottoms aint coming off tho. we took turns taking cold showers, shared soap, and all felt a whole lot 
closer lol. there were also a ton of bugs inside, and we were all freaking out about it, it was chill tho lol. 
</p>

<p>
after we finished, sara came to warn us that apparently our bus driver had been taking pictures of us and to be careful 
walking around in just bathing suits. apparently it was bad enough that they said to wake them up in the middle of the
night if the driver was sitting on the path to the bathroom. we quickly covered up and walking back, and sara was such
a real one, she covered me as i walked cause the driver was on the steps that we passed by, it was fucking weird.
</p>

<p>
we got back and started feasting, larry also brought sun chips bought at costco, it was so yummy. the donuts were also
suprisingly bomb hehe, i loved the straberry jam one. we started watching 20th century girl, but couldnt get very far 
until we were tired and had to go brush our teeth to stay awake, so we went and did that - the bathrooms were so freaking
crowded tho, ugh. we also caught some frogs in AJ's shower so they could go in, they were so cute lil guys.
