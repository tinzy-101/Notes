How does interrupt processing happen on CPUs? e.g. RCA1802 CPU
	1. fetching instruction from mem:
		--&gt; A register = program counter, but real program counter = 1/16 
		--&gt; P 4-bit register = designates program counter tjat's sent to A register 
		--&gt; X 4-bit register = points to which one is the data register 
	2. interrupt comes in (everything happens in hardware, all at the same time)
		--&gt; R1 always used as program counter when interrupt recieved (when build OS, need to set R1, so can function with interrupt service routine
		--&gt; need to point to R1 to 
		--&gt; hardware takes P and X registers and store in T (temp) register
		--&gt; X and P set to new values:
			--&gt; X = 0x2
			--&gt; P = 0x1
		--&gt; turn off interrupts so it can first service the current interrupt
	3. start next fetch
		--&gt; next fetch = whatever address is in R1
		--&gt; need to save contents in T
		--&gt; reset X and P from T
		--&gt; enable interrupt flip flop
R0 points to DMA (for I/O), R1 = interrupt hander, R2 = data stack for OS, R3 = where other programs start

Example:
A OS load time:
	1. put interrupt handler @ address 6000
	2. put stack space for X at 7000
	3. set R1 to 6000 (bc interrupt address)
	4. set R2 to 700 (bc where stack space is)
	5. now, use only R3 and up
Memory address programs: (these are the "P" addresses, and "X" addresses are not showed here)
	A - 1000
	B - 2000
	C - 3000
	D - 4000
	E - 5000
Program B executes:
	R3 = 2044
	R4 = 2A00
	P = 3
	X = 4
Interrupt occurs:
	1. X&amp;P stored in T (3 and 4)
	2. x = 2, P = 1
	3. disable interrupts
	4. fetch isntruction at: P1 (6000) and P2 (7000)
Start OS handler:
	1. save T register
	2. save all registers
	3. process interrupt
	4. 
End of routine:
	1. restore registers from R3 to R16
	2. reset P1 = 6000 (want to repeat interrupt routine), don't reset 7000 yet
	3. return and restart by loading T into X and P, and can start fetching again

** Key Concept: interrupts only processed after finish execution and DMA **

Test:
	Ch1 and Ch2
	5 T/F (3pt)
	5 M/C (5pt)
	5 essay (8pt)
	**write everything in your words!!!

General general format for processing interrupts 
1. change registers
2. stop interrupts
3. load OS
4. change to level 0 (kernel mode)

Internal CPU Interrupts:
Traps:
	-request for service (e.g. INT 21 mechanism in DOS --&gt; software instruction that starts interrupt)
	-execute cyce error (e.g. divide by zero flag set)
Exceptions:
	-invalid instruction (e.g. program changes process data)
	-priviledged instruction error (e.g. in user mode trying to do stuff meant for kernel mode)
	-during fetching an instruction/data not in program's mem (programming in C and changing ptrs)

External CPU interrupts (from devices outside the CPU):
	-Timer (update internal clock kept by OS, interrupt happens every x nanoseconds)
	-I/O completion (an I/O device completed for a process, they run at diff speeds)
	-Power failure (OS needs to shutdown property b4 all failure, so no issue when startup)
	-Other devices need attention (keyboard, mouse, printer, USB)
		--&gt; every time mouse is moved, theres an interrupt

	--&gt; process = program in execution (many people say: task, program, process)
	--&gt; OS executes many programs:
		--&gt; batch system = jobs (many programs run in the background)
		--&gt; time-shared system = user programs/tasks
	--&gt; job: set it up and run &gt;1 program consecutively vs process: program in execution, if program doesn't branch or call to other functions, then is sequential
	--&gt; parts of a process:
		1. program code = text section
		2. current activity: program counter (address of next instructionn to fetch), processor registers 
		3. stack w/ temp data: func params return addresses, local vars
		4. data section: global vars
		5. heap: dynamically allocated mem during run time 
	--&gt; program= passive on an executable vs process=active, program is executed
	--&gt; start program w/ GUI or command line
	--&gt; 1 program can be many processes 
		--&gt; many users exec same program OR multiple processes exec same program

<pre>
	--&gt; process execute and it changes state (process state transition diagram**)
		1. user wants to start new program --&gt; goto new state + master schedulers determines if the program becomes a real program to run (says that system has enough resources to run process)
		2. new process admitted by scheduler and give enough resources to go to ready state
			--&gt; inside ready state have ready queue, waiting for CPU 
		3. short term dispatcher moves ready process to CPU, and in executing state now
		4. Process executes until...
			1. requests service (interrupt and OS comes in and puts process into block state + start service)
				--&gt; I/O request is performed asynchronously, but at the same time as CPU 
				--&gt; I/O completes, and there is I/O completion interrupt
				--&gt; take from blocked state to ready state
			2. normal exit: process times out from clock (OS comes in and places process in ready state)
			3. abnormal exit: something bad happens in program (exception interrupt, and process put in terminated state) 
		5. If the CPU is so overloaded:
			1. process in ready state moved to suspended ready state
				--&gt; when CPU gets better, process is moved by to ready state with a "resume"
				--&gt; same thing can happen when in blocked state 
					--&gt; when in blocked state, the process is still holding up resources, to move to a suspended blocked state to free up resources. when I/O finishes its thing and sends out an interrupt, process moved to suspended ready state like above CPU example
		6. "held" state
