OS = middleman between user and computer hardware --&gt; make things efficient for user
	--&gt; made up of: CPU, memory, I?O devices, storage (OS needs to allocate resources for them)
broad view of computers: 
	user &lt;--&gt; apps &lt;--&gt; OS &lt;--&gt; computer hardware (CPU, memory, I/O, etc)
	hardware = basic computing resources 
	apps = define ways hardware used to solve user's problems

<span id="1.2 Computer-system organization-Interupts"></span><strong id="Interupts">Interupts</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; typical computer operation: program doing I/O
		 1. device driver loads registers in devControl
		 2. devControl looks at registers to see what to do (read char from keyboard)
		 3. devControl transfer data from device to local buffer
		 4. devCOntrol tells device driver its done --&gt; using INTERRUPT
		 5. device driver give control to other parts of OS 
	--&gt; hardware triggers interrupt by sending signal to CPU (using bus) 
	--&gt; when CPU interrupted, stops, and transfers execution to fixed location, when finished, keeps doing og task
	--&gt; every computer has own interrupt mechanism
	--&gt; common tasks of interupts mech:
		-need to transfer control to correct interrupt service routine
		-need someone to examine interupt routine, then call the interrupt-specific handler 
		-call interupt routine thru table of pointers (table=interrupt vector stored in low memory)
		-save state info of whatever interrupted
		-modify processor state (e.g. register values) and save it
implementation:
	--&gt; CPU hardware has interrupt-request line, CPU senss after executing every instruction
	--&gt; if CPU detects a controller send signal on interrupt-request line:
		--&gt; read interrupt num (corresp to inter vector) + jump to interrupt handler routine 
		--&gt; interrupt handler saves states 
	--&gt; summary: devCOntrol raises an interrupt thru signal on IR line, CPU catched interrupt and dispatches to interrupt handler, interrupt handler clears interrupt by servicing device
issue: need more complex interrupt system --&gt; solution: interrupt controller hardware
	1. 2 interrupt request lines: nonmaskable (for unrecoverable mem errs) + maskable (for devControl to request service, can be temp. ignored)
	2. interrupt chaining = each element in interrupt vector points to head of interrupt handlers
		--&gt; solves issue of having more interrupts than space in table
	3. interrupt priority levels: CPU can pick and choose which is more important to handle first
summary:
	--&gt; interrupt handle asynch events
	--&gt; devControllers and hardware faults raise interrupts
	--&gt; need to be efficient in interrupt handling

<span id="1.2 Computer-system organization-Storage Structure"></span><strong id="Storage Structure">Storage Structure</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; CPU only loads instructions from memory, so all programs need to be loaded to mem
		--&gt; most comps load programs from writeable mem (RAM) 
		--&gt; main mem in semiconductors = dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
	--&gt; all mem has array of bytes with own address 
		--&gt; use "load" (move byte from main mem to CPU registers) and "store" (opposite load) to manipulate 
		--&gt; CPU autmatcally laods isntructions from main mem 
	--&gt; Intstruction execution cycle:
		1. fetch instruction from mem and store in instruction register
		2. isntruction decoded + operands fetched and stored in internal register
		3. execute instruction on operands
		4. result stored back in memory 
			--&gt; want everything stored permanent in main mem, but not possible (too small, volatile)
			--&gt; solution: secondary storage (hard disk drives, NVM devices) 
					--&gt; mostly everything store here b4 loaded into mem, but much slower 
					--&gt; also have tertiary storag: blu ray, CD-ROM (outside storage) 
		
		Volatile mem types: smallest to largest, fastest to slowest to access (all volatile)
		_register &lt;--&gt; cache &lt;--&gt; main mem_ 
		**larger storage = slower usually 
		**all semiconductor mem
		**volatile storage = mem, other mem will be specific 
		
		NonVolatile mem types: small to large, fast to slow (NVS)
		_nonvolatile mem &lt;--&gt; hard disk drive &lt;--&gt; optical disk &lt;--&gt; magnetic tapes_
		**mechanical (HDD, optical disk, cheaper, larger) vs electrical=NVM (flash mem, fram, nram, ssd)

</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; use direct mem access (DMA) to move large data amt via I/O 
		--&gt; I/O device gets a large chuck of data directly from main mem, or vice versa 
		--&gt; only need 1 interrupt per block to tell dev driver that operation done 
			--&gt; frees up CPU to do other stuff 
	--&gt; some systems use switch arch vs bus arch (dont need to share like a bus, multiple components talk to each other at the same time)
		--&gt; DMA works better here

	--&gt; 2+ processors, each w/ 1 core CPU; processors share mem over computer bus

		--&gt; each processor has own registers and private cache
	--&gt; symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) = eac CPU performs all tasks
	--&gt; multiprocessor include multicore (many cores on one chip)
		--&gt; each core has own regiser + local cache (level 1 cache = L1, level 2 cache = L2 shared by 2 cores)
		--&gt; lower level caches (L1) faster than higher level shared caches 
	--&gt; adding CPUs increases processing up to extent (eventually becomes bottleneck when sharing bus)
		--&gt; alternatively: give each CPU local mem + bus (use shared system interconnect)
		--&gt; non uniform mem access; scales well as more CPUs
		--&gt; cons: latency when CPU accesses remote mem (if CPU 1 needs to access CPU 3)

		--&gt; CPU never idle

		--&gt; e.g. virtual machine manager can control the system 
	--&gt; system calls invoked thru trap to location in interrupt vector 
		--&gt; syscalls treated like software interrupts, go to kernel to see what needs to specifically be done

<p>
<span id="1.5 Resource management-Memory management"></span><strong id="Memory management">Memory management</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; main mem = array of bytes, each with own address
		--&gt; quickly accesses by CPU and i/o devs 
		--&gt; CPU reads instructions from main mem directly and writes to it
	--&gt; to improve CPU usage, modern computers store programs in mem, which is why we need memory management
		--&gt; mem management scheme mostly depends on hardware 
	--&gt; needs to:
		--&gt; keep track which mem used by who
		--&gt; allocate and deallocate mem

		--&gt; manage free space/storage
		--&gt; sceudle disks
		--&gt; partition
		--&gt; protect
	--&gt; most programs stored on secondary storage b4 loaded to mem

</pre>
<p>
<span id="1.5 Resource management-Cache management"></span><strong id="Cache management">Cache management</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	--&gt; cache = faster storage system for stuff to be put in temporarily from mem 
		--&gt; when system needs something, check if its alrd in cache, if not load it in
	--&gt; use internal programmable registers as cache for main mem
		--&gt; use algos to decide which to keep in registers and which in main mem
	--&gt; some caches built into hardware
		--&gt; e.g. instruction cache 
	--&gt; cache management very complicated with multiprocessing systems
		--&gt; each CPU has local cache, so copy of a piece of data can exist in many caches
		--&gt; need to worry about cache coherency, if 1 version is updated, all updated
