OS = middleman between user and computer hardware --&gt; make things efficient for user
	--&gt; made up of: CPU, memory, I?O devices, storage (OS needs to allocate resources for them)
broad view of computers: 
	user &lt;--&gt; apps &lt;--&gt; OS &lt;--&gt; computer hardware (CPU, memory, I/O, etc)
	hardware = basic computing resources 
	apps = define ways hardware used to solve user's problems 
	OS = control hardware, coordinate hardware use for user, environment for system to do work
<span id="1.1 What Operating systems do-User View:"></span><strong id="User View:">User View:</strong>
	laptops + phones: have user view thru screen
	embedded computers: use keypas, voice recognition
<span id="1.1 What Operating systems do-System View:"></span><strong id="System View:">System View:</strong>
	OS is resource allocator 
	OS is a control program --&gt; manage execution of user programs
<span id="1.1 What Operating systems do-OS Definition"></span><strong id="OS Definition">OS Definition</strong>
	no set definition (see above)
	common def: OS is the one program running on computer at all times (kernel)
</p>
<pre><code>--&gt; OS = kernl + system programs + app programs + device drivers

modern computer system = (1+)CPUs + device controllers connected by bus 
</p>
<pre><code>--&gt; each device controller in charge of a device (graphics, disk drive)
--&gt; can have more than one device attached 
--&gt; device controller maintains local buffer storage + special registers
--&gt; device controller needs to move data b/w peripherals and local buffers
--&gt; device driver for each device controller
--&gt; understand devControl and is interface for rest of OS
--&gt; works in parallel with CPU

<span id="1.2 Computer-system organization-Interupts"></span><strong id="Interupts">Interupts</strong>
	--&gt; typical computer operation: program doing I/O
</p>
<ol>
<li>
device driver loads registers in devControl

<li>
devControl looks at registers to see what to do (read char from keyboard)

<li>
devControl transfer data from device to local buffer

<li>
devCOntrol tells device driver its done --&gt; using INTERRUPT

<li>
device driver give control to other parts of OS 
	--&gt; hardware triggers interrupt by sending signal to CPU (using bus) 
	--&gt; when CPU interrupted, stops, and transfers execution to fixed location, when finished, keeps doing og task
	--&gt; every computer has own interrupt mechanism
	--&gt; common tasks of interupts mech:
		-need to transfer control to correct interrupt service routine
		-need someone to examine interupt routine, then call the interrupt-specific handler 
		-call interupt routine thru table of pointers (table=interrupt vector stored in low memory)
		-save state info of whatever interrupted
		-modify processor state (e.g. register values) and save it

</ol>
<p>
implementation:
	--&gt; CPU hardware has interrupt-request line, CPU senss after executing every instruction
	--&gt; if CPU detects a controller send signal on interrupt-request line:
		--&gt; read interrupt num (corresp to inter vector) + jump to interrupt handler routine 
		--&gt; interrupt handler saves states 
	--&gt; summary: devCOntrol raises an interrupt thru signal on IR line, CPU catched interrupt and dispatches to interrupt handler, interrupt handler clears interrupt by servicing device
issue: need more complex interrupt system --&gt; solution: interrupt controller hardware
</p>
<ol>
<li>
2 interrupt request lines: nonmaskable (for unrecoverable mem errs) + maskable (for devControl to request service, can be temp. ignored)

<li>
interrupt chaining = each element in interrupt vector points to head of interrupt handlers
		--&gt; solves issue of having more interrupts than space in table

<li>
interrupt priority levels: CPU can pick and choose which is more important to handle first

</ol>
<p>
summary:
	--&gt; interrupt handle asynch events
	--&gt; devControllers and hardware faults raise interrupts
	--&gt; need to be efficient in interrupt handling

<span id="1.2 Computer-system organization-Storage Structure"></span><strong id="Storage Structure">Storage Structure</strong>
	--&gt; CPU only loads instructions from memory, so all programs need to be loaded to mem
		--&gt; most comps load programs from writeable mem (RAM) 
		--&gt; main mem in semiconductors = dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
	--&gt; all mem has array of bytes with own address 
		--&gt; use "load" (move byte from main mem to CPU registers) and "store" (opposite load) to manipulate 
		--&gt; CPU autmatcally laods isntructions from main mem 
	--&gt; Intstruction execution cycle:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
fetch instruction from mem and store in instruction register

<li>
isntruction decoded + operands fetched and stored in internal register

<li>
execute instruction on operands

<li>
result stored back in memory 
			--&gt; want everything stored permanent in main mem, but not possible (too small, volatile)
			--&gt; solution: secondary storage (hard disk drives, NVM devices) 
					--&gt; mostly everything store here b4 loaded into mem, but much slower 
					--&gt; also have tertiary storag: blu ray, CD-ROM (outside storage) 

</ol>
		
<p>
		Volatile mem types: smallest to largest, fastest to slowest to access (all volatile)
		<em>register &lt;--&gt; cache &lt;--&gt; main mem</em> 
		**larger storage = slower usually 
		**all semiconductor mem
		**volatile storage = mem, other mem will be specific 
</p>
		
<p>
		NonVolatile mem types: small to large, fast to slow (NVS)
		<em>nonvolatile mem &lt;--&gt; hard disk drive &lt;--&gt; optical disk &lt;--&gt; magnetic tapes</em>
		**mechanical (HDD, optical disk, cheaper, larger) vs electrical=NVM (flash mem, fram, nram, ssd)
</p>
		
<p>
<span id="1.2 Computer-system organization-I/O Structure"></span><strong id="I/O Structure">I/O Structure</strong>
	--&gt; use direct mem access (DMA) to move large data amt via I/O 
		--&gt; I/O device gets a large chuck of data directly from main mem, or vice versa 
		--&gt; only need 1 interrupt per block to tell dev driver that operation done 
			--&gt; frees up CPU to do other stuff 
	--&gt; some systems use switch arch vs bus arch (dont need to share like a bus, multiple components talk to each other at the same time)
		--&gt; DMA works better here

</p>
<pre><code>have special purpose processors too for peripherals (keyboard, monitor)
--&gt; special purpose cannot run processes, have limited abilitird
--&gt; sometimes CPU tells them tasks
--&gt; sometimes s.p. processors run by selves 
</code></pre>
<p>
<span id="1.3 Computer-system Architecture-Multiprocessor systems"></span><strong id="Multiprocessor systems">Multiprocessor systems</strong>
	--&gt; 2+ processors, each w/ 1 core CPU; processors share mem over computer bus 
		--&gt; has increased throughput (more work done in less time) 
		--&gt; each processor has own registers and private cache
	--&gt; symmetri multiprocessing (SMP) = eac CPU performs all tasks
	--&gt; multiprocessor include multicore (many cores on one chip)
		--&gt; each core has own regiser + local cache (level 1 cache = L1, level 2 cache = L2 shared by 2 cores)
		--&gt; lower level caches (L1) faster than higher level shared caches 
	--&gt; adding CPUs increases processing up to extent (eventually becomes bottleneck when sharing bus)
		--&gt; alternatively: give each CPU local mem + bus (use shared system interconnect)
		--&gt; non uniform mem access; scales well as more CPUs
		--&gt; cons: latency when CPU accesses remote mem (if CPU 1 needs to access CPU 3) 
	--&gt; blade servers = system with multiple processors, I/O boards, networking boards
		--&gt; each blade processor board has own OS, some are multiproessors
<span id="1.3 Computer-system Architecture-Vocab"></span><strong id="Vocab">Vocab</strong>
	<em>CPU</em> = hardware that executes instructions

	<em>core</em> = basic computation unit of CPU
<span id="1.3 Computer-system Architecture-Clustered systems"></span><strong id="Clustered systems">Clustered systems</strong>
	clustered system = gather multiple CPUs, connected via LAN 
		--&gt; good for high availability service (works even if some of systems in cluster fail) 
		--&gt; graceful degradation (provides value even as hardware degrades) 
		--&gt; fault tolerant (suffer failure but still work)
		--&gt; high performacne computing
		--&gt; parallelization: divide program into separate components running in parallel on diff cores
	assymmetric clustering: one machine in standby and monitoring, other runs apps
</p>
<pre><code>will switch over to standby if main fails
</code></pre>
<p>
	symmetric clustering: 2+ hosts run apps and monitor eachother (most efficient) 
	storage area networks = let many systems attach to 1 storage areas

<span id="1.4 OS operations-Booting computer"></span><strong id="Booting computer">Booting computer</strong>
	--&gt; need initial program to run: bootstrap program (stored in computer hardware/firmware)
		--&gt; initialized CPU register + devControl + mem + OS kernel
	--&gt; once kernel loaded, can provide service to system + users 
	--&gt; system daemons: services outside of kernel (run whil kernel runs) 
	--&gt; OS waits for stuff to do via traps (exceptions)
		--&gt; type of interrupt from software (bc error or user request = system call)
<span id="1.4 OS operations-Multiprogramming and multitasking"></span><strong id="Multiprogramming and multitasking">Multiprogramming and multitasking</strong>
	--&gt; multiprogramming = use CPU more efficiently 
		--&gt; OS keeps processes in mem at same time (process = program executing)
		--&gt; OS picks one to do, if needs to wait for I/O stuff, then move on and come back 
		--&gt; CPU never idle 
	--&gt; multitasking = CPU does many processes at same time + switch b/w them quickly
		--&gt; gives user faster response time 
	--&gt; requires mem management + CPU scheduling 
		--&gt; use virtual mem: execute process not completely in mem 
			--&gt; user can run programs larger than physical mem
			--&gt; separate logical mem fro physical mem 
	--&gt; need file system on secondary storage + storage management + process synch + resource protection
<span id="1.4 OS operations-Dual-mode and multimode operation"></span><strong id="Dual-mode and multimode operation">Dual-mode and multimode operation</strong>
	--&gt; need to make sure bad program cant affect other parts of ssytem 
	--&gt; solution: user mode vs kernel mode 
		--&gt; mode bit = added to comp hardware (0 = kernel, 1 = user)
		--&gt; know what task is performed for user vs os
		--&gt; when user makes system call (request for os to do something), comp switch to kernel mode
</p>

<p>
	system boot --&gt; OS loaded in kernel mode --&gt; start user apps in user mode --&gt; if trap or interrupt, hardware switch to kernel mode
</p>
	
<p>
	--&gt; can have &gt;1 modes
		--&gt; e.g. 4 protection rings (0 = kernel, 1&amp;2 for OS services, 3 = user)
		--&gt; e.g. virtual machine manager can control the system 
	--&gt; system calls invoked thru trap to location in interrupt vector 
		--&gt; syscalls treated like software interrupts, go to kernel to see what needs to specifically be done 
		--&gt; if there are errors in user space, hardware traps to OS so OS can end program 
			--&gt; mem might be dumped into file so user sees whats wrong
<span id="1.4 OS operations-Timer"></span><strong id="Timer">Timer</strong>
