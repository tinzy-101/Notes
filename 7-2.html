<pre>
Today we went out with 영에이모의 친구, 단비's mom. After meeting us on a walk the day before, she really wanted to treat us
to coffe at this really famous factory/warehouse-turned cafe called Onions. She always looks super sad and doesn't talk much, 
but apparently when she saw us, she totally lit up, which was so sweet. We met up at 4pm right after school, and it was POURING.
We made the short walk to the cafe, and everything was super expensive lol. I got the hot chocolate, and we shared this really good sugar bread,
grape and apple bread, and chocolate bread.

단비's mom looked so happy with us there, and we were talking all about her. 영에이모 said this was the most she'd every talked before. She did business
in Africa, and Sophia told her about the guy she met at the ROK-US-Japan tech exhibition, who is currently in Tanzania teaching kids about tech lol. Apparently
she really loves Africa, and East Africa is super safe. Makes me want to visit one day...

We stayed there for a few hours before we went home. At home, I helped 영에이모 correct her English sentences. She so cute...everytime we have to Papago something,
she'll just keep everything she translates as one big paragraph in the app, and at the end of the day she'll individually translate sentences and write them down 
in her notebook, and I helped her with the right grammar and pronounciation. We're already making plans for after we leave to video call and continue practicing
Korean and English together :'))) I'm gonna miss her a lot.
