Today was a chill day back in class where we learned some grammar and some vocab about our appearances and personality
again. realiing it was the last monday we would have in korea made it feel super sad.....especially seeing seonsangnim,
cause we only have 2 more classes left :(( really gonna miss her. today in class we played put a finger down again and
i was pretty devious saying that everyone not wearing a blue shirt should put a finger down (only me and kunkel passed)
jenny and kyle were also there to observe the class, and they ended up playing with us. at the end of the game it was
down to me and kyle, and i got him out with his red shorts haha...as he walked out he told me he wouldnt forget this LOL
선생님 gave me some apple crackers for winning and sophie thought the she had favorites LOL kunkel also expected me to
share haha
</p>

<p>
after class we decided we were in the mood for moms touch, so got 3 chickens to shared, it was so yummy (i still owe ivy
</p>
<ol>
<li>
for that meal hehe, so nomnomnom. ellie came with us too. we absolutely devoured that chicken even when we were 

</ol>
<p>
worried that we might not have enough time to finish cause the order took a while to make. we literally finished in 10 
min. we went back for tutoring, and got infor about our trip to 안동, and our our roomate assignments, salene wasnt with
us, which were gonna try to negotiate. she also ended up crying, thinking about this and about her shitty host fam 
situtation.....still cannot believe she wasnt moved :((
</p>

<p>
we also celebrated jolees birthday with this really good oreo cake, the cream was so freaking light. really delicious. 
i felt like such a fatass cause i had the red bean bread and the xl onigiri before, but it was so yummy heheh.
we also took mugshots of ourselves with our name and number LOL, it was pretty fun.
</p>

<p>
after we finished up "tutoring" we had to do our one on ones (kunkel forced me to switch with him...so i had to wait til
the end cause hes #20) but luckily i was with jennie whos efficient. also apparenyl my supporter got blacklisted for 
how she was acting LOL.
</p>

<p>
also, while we were bored waiting for my one on one, we started analyzing the seating arrangements for the plane and
planning who we would ask to switch with. we literally put in everyones last name to search for them, made a spreadsheet,
then laryssa drew a plan out, it was highk so obssessive LOLLL but we did figure something out....but highly dependent
on whether people with agree to switch or not. fun nevertheless haha
I also talked to laryssa a bit abotu the summer math REUs im applying to, and theres one in chicago! shes willing to 
house me, which is good bc the program doesnt provide housing. it also doesnt have too many benefits but ill apply cause
아마 reunion???
</p>

<p>
after my one on one, we went to wangshimri to go shopping! we went to daiso where i got more bulk snacks LOL, its kinda 
bad, but at least these are for friends. I also need to get dad nuts lol. hopefully hell like them. i went to emart to
hopefully find swim short, but they were so damn expensive, and for what???
</p>

<p>
after that we went to gangnam! i really wasnt expecting to go cause i thought it was like 40 min away, but it was 
actually only 30! i still dont have data tho so i couldnt navigate and had to beg for a hotspot LOLL, it was sad. 
the commute there was actually hell. on the first ride there were not that many people, but they started piling in as 
we traveled more, to the point where we were all packed together and as the subway made sudden moves, me and ivy were
pressed against the back of the subway by all of the other people. the transfer to another line was actual hell.
we got there later, soon before the subways was gonna arrive, so we were in the back of the line and the last people to 
squeeze in. ivy, izzie and laryssa were able to squeeze in close to each other, but i was behind them, and sqeeezed in
near the door. my bag was shoved between 2 people, and i was shoved between 2 other people. there was this old man behind
me and i felt bad cause i kept leaning on him, it was literally that close, i could FEEL all of the people around me,
its absolute hell during rushhour. the old man kept clearing his throat too which was weird. thankfully it was just
one stop tho! when we got off we were all dehydrated and craving gongcha, but we were on a timecrush so went to shop 1st.
</p>

<p>
we got there and went to minibrand!! it had super cheap and cut shirts, esp tanks with padding. unfortunatley all the 
tanktops were too small or short, but i did find 4 super nice shirts! pink, white, black cropped and a snoopy hehe. we 
all had a really good time cause we need to spend our korean cash lolol.
</p>

<p>
i was only planning on being there but 30 min but ended up staying 45, so i didnt get home till 8...yikes lol but imo
was honestly really chill about it, so i lowk wanna stay out later and eat dinner with friends on wednesday (혹시 노새방?
we def have to go one last time omg, and sing starman). we ate dinner together (no 김선생님), and we had some stir fried
meat that was really yummy, and also some veggie 만두. omnomnom. then we finished, showered (sophie kept snenzing and 
prob has a cold which means i prob have a cold....), and sat down to watch the olympics together! it was korea vs japan
in archery, so you know that 이모하고 심선생님 were rooting for korea. she was very vocal about hating japan lol. while
the koreas were going shes say "10!" but while the japanese were going shed say "7!" or wish that the wind was very
strong "파람많아요!" LOLLL 
also, 꿀떡 was with us but she went to 김, and walked all over his newspaper. he moved her the first time, but the 2nd
time he literally grabbed her was the scruff (all the loose skin at the neck) to pick her up...just insane. no wonder
she sometimes prefers us....i bet that hurt...
</p>

<p>
after that i had an existential crisis about leaving korea and kept making plans for things to do...to many things and 
too lttle time together...def have to pull up to chicago together one day to meet up....
</p>

<p>
twas a good yet sad day!
