	- security = measure of confience that system/data is preserved
	  - guarding omputer resources (info in system, CPU, mem, secondary storage, networking)
	  - use cryptography
	- protection = mechanisms to control access to processes

<pre>
	- secure = system's resources used and accessed as intended under all circumstances 
	  - can't get total security, but can get close to it w/ very little security breaches 
	- security breach = intentional or accidental 
	  - breach of confidentiality = steal info
	  - breach of integrity = unauthorized mod of data
	  - breach of availability = unauthorized destruction of dta
	  - theft of service = unauthorized use of resources
	  - denial of service (DOS) = prevents legit use of system, sometimes accidental  
	
	Strategies used by hackers: 
		1. masquerading = one side of communication pretends to be someone else  
			- breach authentication = gain access not usually allowed 
		2. replay attack = malicious repeat of valid data transmission 
			- usually do with message mod = attacker changes data in com w/o sender's knowledge 
		3. man-in-the-middle = attacker sits in data flow, masquerading as sender/reciever to both sides
			- session hijacking can happen before = intercept active communication 
		4. privilege escalation 
			- system has multiple privilege sets, each user assigned one privilege leevl 
			- giving attacker greater privilege than it should have on system 
	
	How to protect system: 
		1. Physical 
				- site w/ computer needs to be protected 
		2. Networks 
				- networking = good to access resources outside of system, but can let attackers in 
		3. OS 
				- if have insecure settings + configs can have security bugs 
				- attack surface = set of points attacker tries to break in 
		4. Apps 
				- apps w/ too much privilege can let attackers in 
				  
	4 layer security model: 
		- have chain of links b/w physical, networks, OS, apps, if 1 goes down everyone else also goes down 
		- need to protect against humans too
