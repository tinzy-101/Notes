</p>
<pre>
	- security = measure of confience that system/data is preserved
	  - guarding omputer resources (info in system, CPU, mem, secondary storage, networking)
	  - use cryptography
	- protection = mechanisms to control access to processes 
</pre>

<p>
<span id="16.1 The Security Problem-The security problem"></span><strong id="The security problem">The security problem</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- secure = system's resources used and accessed as intended under all circumstances 
	  - can't get total security, but can get close to it w/ very little security breaches 
	- security breach = intentional or accidental 
	  - breach of confidentiality = steal info
	  - breach of integrity = unauthorized mod of data
	  - breach of availability = unauthorized destruction of dta
	  - theft of service = unauthorized use of resources
	  - denial of service (DOS) = prevents legit use of system, sometimes accidental  
	
	Strategies used by hackers: 
		1. masquerading = one side of communication pretends to be someone else  
			- breach authentication = gain access not usually allowed 
		2. replay attack = malicious repeat of valid data transmission 
			- usually do with message mod = attacker changes data in com w/o sender's knowledge 
		3. man-in-the-middle = attacker sits in data flow, masquerading as sender/reciever to both sides
			- session hijacking can happen before = intercept active communication 
		4. privilege escalation 
			- system has multiple privilege sets, each user assigned one privilege leevl 
			- giving attacker greater privilege than it should have on system 
	
	How to protect system: 
		1. Physical 
				- site w/ computer needs to be protected 
		2. Networks 
				- networking = good to access resources outside of system, but can let attackers in 
		3. OS 
				- if have insecure settings + configs can have security bugs 
				- attack surface = set of points attacker tries to break in 
		4. Apps 
				- apps w/ too much privilege can let attackers in 
				  
	4 layer security model: 
		- have chain of links b/w physical, networks, OS, apps, if 1 goes down everyone else also goes down 
		- need to protect against humans too

<p>
<span id="16.2 Program Threats-Malware"></span><strong id="Malware">Malware</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- malware = software designed to exploit, disable, damange computer systems
		- e.g. trojan horse: acts in caldestine/malicious manner instead of doing what it said it wold do
		- e.g. spyware: software that comes w/ program user installs, downloads ads onto system and create pop ups
		- e.g. ransomware: encrypt info on computer, need to pay money to get decryption key
		- trap door = designer of program leaves hole in software that only they can use 
		  - use for embezzlement w/ cod rounding errors 
		  - logic bomb = trap door that operatores only on specific set of logica conditions, hard to detect 
		  - very difficult to detect b/c need to look in all lines of the code 
	- principle of least privilege = every program + every privileged user should operate w/ least possible privilege to finish the job 
	  - malware violates this

<span id="16.2 Program Threats-Code Injection"></span><strong id="Code Injection">Code Injection</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- code injection = executable code added or modded
	- happens bc of bad/insecure programming paradigms, especially in c/cpp
	- one example = buffer overflow, esp malicious bc can run b/w systems t + travel over communication channels
</pre>
<p>
<span id="16.2 Program Threats-Viruses and worms"></span><strong id="Viruses and worms">Viruses and worms</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- virus = fragment of code embedded in legit program, self replicated and infects other programs 
	- can destroy fs
	
	types of viruses: 
		1. file: file virus infects system by appending self to file, will take control then return control
		2. boot: infect boot sector, exec everytime sys booted and OS loaded 
			- not in fs, "memory virus"
			- can infect EFI
		3. macro: written in high level language like visual basic 
			- most viruses written in low level, like c/cpp
			- exec when macro run 
		4. rootkit: viruses that infect os itself
			- sys completely compromised
		5. source code: include itself w/ source code 
		6. polymorphic: changes each time installed to avoid detection 
			- changes virus signature = pattern used to identy (bytes) 
		7. encrypted: will decrypt then exec
		8. stealth: mods parts of system used to identify it, so cannot be id'ed
		9. multipartite: can infect many parts of system
		10. armored: obfuscated, so antivirus researchers cannot unravel and understand
	
	big problem w/ security today = monoculture = many systems have same hardware and os, so easy to infect

<div id="16.3 System and Network Threats"><h3 id="16.3 System and Network Threats" class="header"><a href="#16.3 System and Network Threats">16.3 System and Network Threats</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	- security threats a lot worse if connected to network
	- hackers usually attack from zombie systems = independent systems w/ devices compromised by hackers, but still usable to og owner 
	  - hard to track hacker
	  - wifi makes it even harder to track
</pre>

<span id="16.3 System and Network Threats-Attacking network traffic"></span><strong id="Attacking network traffic">Attacking network traffic</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- sniffing = passively intercept network traffic
	- spoofing = pretending to be one party and recieving info/sending info 
</pre>

<span id="16.3 System and Network Threats-Denial of Service"></span><strong id="Denial of Service">Denial of Service</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- not trying to get info/steal resources, but disables system
	- usually based on network = attack facility resources OR disrupt network of facility
	- cant prevent 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="16.3 System and Network Threats-Port Scanning"></span><strong id="Port Scanning">Port Scanning</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- port scanning = way to find system vulnerabilities, usually automated
		- part of fingerprinting = attacker finds OS used and set of services to find vulnerabilities 
</pre>


<div id="16.4 Cryptography as a security tool"><h3 id="16.4 Cryptography as a security tool" class="header"><a href="#16.4 Cryptography as a security tool">16.4 Cryptography as a security tool</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	- cryptography = way to constrain potential senders / recievers of messages, b/c cant trust network
	- use keys = distributed to come computers in networks, can only decode message if have key 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="16.4 Cryptography as a security tool-Encryption"></span><strong id="Encryption">Encryption</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- encryption very common, send messages securely across network
	- use set of keys, messages, ciphertexts
	- symmetric vs assymetric encryption: 
	  	1. symmetric encryption = same key used to encrypt and decrypt 
			- data encryption standard (DES) cipher = used byt NIST, but is insecure 
			- stream cipher = en/decrypt stream of bytes or bits rather than block, more efficent 
		2. asymmetric encryption = different encryption + decryption keys 
			- any sender can use one key to encrypt a message, but only key creator can decrypt the message 
			  	- public key encryption 
			- RSA = mot common, use public key private key, and product of 2 random prime numbers 
			- more expensive than symmetric
</pre>
<p>
<span id="16.4 Cryptography as a security tool-Authentication"></span><strong id="Authentication">Authentication</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- authentication = constraining potential senders f message 
	- use set of keys, messages, authenticators, and functions to generate authenticators + verifying authnticators 
	- hash function = creates small, fixed size block of data = message digest/hash value useing a message 
	- 2 types of authentication algos: 
	  	1. message authentication code (MAC) 
				- generate cheksum from message using a secret key
				- authenticate short values 
		2. digital signature algo 
			- digital signatures let anyone verify authenticity of message 
	
	can use encryption and authentication together or separately 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="16.4 Cryptography as a security tool-Key Distribution"></span><strong id="Key Distribution">Key Distribution</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- hard to deliver symmetric keys: sometimes deliver out of band 
	- asymmetric keys = can be exchanges in public + one user only needs 1 private key for all communication 
	- need ot use digital certificate: public key digitally signed by trusted party 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="16.4 Cryptography as a security tool-Implementation of Cryptography"></span><strong id="Implementation of Cryptography">Implementation of Cryptography</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- network organized in layers: TCP + IP -&gt; data link layer 
	- implemente cryptography in any layer in network protocol stacks 
	  - no best layer:
				 - lower layer = not enough protection for higher layers, but more protocols will ebenfit 
</pre>

<p>
<span id="16.5 User Authentication-Password vulnerabilities"></span><strong id="Password vulnerabilities">Password vulnerabilities</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- passwords = easiest way to authenticate user identity 
	- very easy to guess passwords + can find via sniffing / monitoring 
	- can secure passwords using hashing (easy to compute hash functions, but very hard to invert) 
	  	- con: anyone w/ copy of password file can run hash routines against it 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="16.5 User Authentication-One time passwords"></span><strong id="One time passwords">One time passwords</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- use set of paried passwords to avoid password sniffing + shoulder surfing 
	- also use 2 factor authentication, or multifactor + biometrics

</pre>
<p>
<span id="16.6 Implementing security defenses-Vulnerability assessment"></span><strong id="Vulnerability assessment">Vulnerability assessment</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- need to do risk assessments analyzing social engineering + port scans + penetration test

</pre>
<p>
<span id="16.6 Implementing security defenses-Intrusion prevention"></span><strong id="Intrusion prevention">Intrusion prevention</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- detect attepted intrusions into computer systems 
	- need to be able to detect quickly + respond

	- 2 methods: 
	  1. signature based detection
	  2. anomaly detections 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="16.6 Implementing security defenses-Virus Protection"></span><strong id="Virus Protection">Virus Protection</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- antivirus programs can disinfect programs
