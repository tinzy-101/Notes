Today was the the kimchi making class! it was actually so fun. We had the morning free so we kinda just hung out with 
이모. We had a pretty late brunch with 김선생님 and the food was pretty buss hehe. AFter that we all went to the daiso
near the apartment and went shopping for a few things. apparently, because lettuce and cucumbers and especially expensive
during the rainy season, she doesn't like buying them. we also went and whole bunhc of ice ceam again, we literally 
filled 2 whole ice cream cooler bags and another huge meat bag...it was so funny walking to the check out wit all of the
ice cream so comical yet so fun hehe. everytime we eat ice cream 이모 is all like "this is too sweet and unhealthy" yet
she still eats haha. on sunday she even ate (will eat?) 3 ice creams, one after every meal LOL and gets a lil sad if we
don't eat it with her 
</p>

<p>
anyways, after we went to the kimchi class wich was in myeongdong. it was also a kimchi museum and it was so freaking 
cool! the history and the amount of different types of kimchi was really impressive, especially the sweet potato stem
kimchi looked super yummy. after 20 of us looked around, we switched off to go to the kimchi mkaing class! we made a 
type of radish kimchi; the radishes were precut, but we had to cut some green onion and onions, all around the same size
so that they would ferment at the same time. we also added this paste that had gochujang, gochugaru, fish sauce, some 
veggies, and etc, to mix into the kimchi. it was super delicious!! cant wait to bring it home.
</p>

<p>
after we finished the class, we had free time for 2 hours. we decided to walk around the area bc there were lots of cute
shops, albeit super overpriced. it started pouring while we were out there, so we hid in an accessory shop where 
everything was super fugly lol. while we were out there, suddenly we heard thest loud drums, and this massive crowd
sweeping through the street. it was a palestine protest and honestly pretty terrifying. apparently some people got 
yelled at for being foreigners and ruining korea.....these people were marching through the rain, it was insane. 
absolute troopers. 
</p>

<p>
after we finished up, we went to the meetup place for dinner in myeongdong, and got moms touch, pretty buss. then we
walked around cause i really wanted to get streetfood haha, but went to daiso first where i got shnacks hehe. we were
too late to get street food by that time unfortunately so we just went to the exit to meet up with our supporters to eat
dinner. being with yongyun was awkward again, though she was nice. she spent most of the time just talking to yeeun. i
talked to alex a bit, and she cried because shes having a hard time making progress in her korean class, and her teacher
keeps talking to her about it.....also,esther and silvia joined our grup bc their supporter wasnt coming, and esther was
surprisingly easy to talk to, it was fun. 
</p>

<p>
after dinner, we walked around some expensive stores and it was pretty boring. then we went to a theater to watch nanta!
it was surprisingly fun, with the 2 main uys really cute (only 4 actors), they were physically so impressive: could
dance, scream, play percussion, chop things to the beat, juggle, lift eachother up, it was pretty insane. the green chef
guy was really cute hehe, so was the blue buff guy (he took his shirt off towards the end of the show lol). they also
pulled alex up to make dumplings lol, and married 2 random people from the audience, cause the whole premise of the show
is making a wedding feast haha, they also threw lots of balls at the audience. surprisngly fun everyone said, not that
sad now that the baseball game was cancelled. 
</p>

<p>
after the play, yongyun literally bolted, pulled yeeun along with her even as she was trying to say bye. after tho, i 
went with laryssa and ivy to walk around and get street food, it was freaking delicious if not way overpriced. laryssa
got a spicy curl potato, ivy got a fish pasty with chocolate, and i got the cheese coin thingy!! so freaking delicious. 
bc the play ended around 9:30, we basically had no curfew, and we ended up leaving at 10pm LOL, it was so fun. definitely
want to explore more seoul nightlife in a future trip. made me feel so nostalgic for taiwan night markets too. 
</p>

<p>
we went home and chilled, and went to sleep, but not before i prepared for my dobongsan hike ;)
