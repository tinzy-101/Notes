this morning at breakfast sophie started feeling sick, we all go masks and disinfectants. she also made sophie take a
whole bunhc of medicines, but since sophie cant swallow pills, she kept laughing at ther calling her a child LOL. sophie
kepts trying to translate the medicines cause she wasnt sure if she could mix them....i kept telling her to just tell
jennie and kyle if she was feeling uncomfortable and didnt want to drink the medicines, but she just downed it lol
</p>

<p>
Today was the last real day of class which was really sad. on the way into the classroom, sophie and i ran into 선생님 
where she did the big heart with her hands for us...so sweet....im gonna miss her so much omg. today in class we started
doing all the OPI practice for the OPI tomorrow. we ended up doing this introduction of friends, and kunkel decided
to write about me, then ivy decided to write about me, and izzie decided to write about me too. it was actually
really sweet because of all the nice things they said about me, made me realize they thought about me a certain, pretty
nice way, different from how i sometimes viewed myself. kunkel wrote about us doing taekwondo together, and described
me as 횔발, which was funny and unexpected. made me realize ill really miss this table group, and kunkel too for all his
stupidity, though really great grasp on grammar. yesterday he also gave me his 1+1 plum drink which was nice. ivy wrote
about how we got 1+1s at the 편의점 together, which was such a small yet big thing...so yummy, have to get them tomorrow.
izzie talked about us going shopping together, and how i look more pretty when i laugh....so incredibly bittersweet,
theyre all such amazing friends. me, kaila, izzie, ivy,a nd kunkel are a great table group ngl, tons of fun. i hope we
can all keep in touch, and meet up again after a while. 
</p>

<p>
during break, i got a cream bread and the tuna onigiri again, felt like a fatass, but it was still so freaking delicious.
for lunch, we werent feeling particularly hungry, so we decided to do ramen at the 편의점 again, probably the last time
seeing that clerk man looking at us like he hates us lol. i had mala ramen which was lok, but izzy, salene, and laryssa
did the 1+1 on this really yummy ramen (i tried izzies leftovers), me and izzie were both super panicked about our white
shirts getting stained lol (i wore the cropped bunny today!). after that, we wernt on a hunt for gongcha, and finally got
it, and me and ivy kidna flopped ngl. we got the mango sago (unknowingly with coconut, which ivy hates), and the cookies
and cream, which were both too sweet and kinda tasted like soap. we also got the try the melon mushrooms! they were 
pretty ok, it was waxy bc we were drinking our cold drinks, but hte flavor wasnt bad. og still best tho, also 100w 
cheaper. 
</p>

<p>
during tutoring, mika went to go buy blue paper and star sticky notes for us to write a card to 선생님, which was really
nice. she also randomly put me in charge of getting flowers, which sucks cause idk if ill be abe to do it. i drew 박보금
for her cause she loves him LOL. we basically just yapped the whole session, and couldnt hangout after class. me ivy and
laryssa went for a hunt for crookie (croissant cookie) in The Bake, but only 1 janky one left. larry and ivy had to go
to costco with their host mom (so jealous) so i just went thrifting in 아름아운가게! it was filled with old ladies so u
know the thrift was good. i got a elder and blackyak hiking shirts + a formal blue shirt for tomorrows ceremony and 
the graduation ceremony. things i have to go back for: kangaroos backpack, heels, white dress shirt brown dress shirt
i spent an embarassingly long time there (2 employee left for a break, came back, and i was still there and they ringed
me up LOL). it was a fun time tho hehe! 
</p>

<p>
i went straight home after, and spent a solid 2 hours packing, it was pretty satisfying to center al the stuff. however
still a little sad to think that this will be the alst time that ill be settled in imo's house....after that i planned
to study for the OPI but that uhhhh never happened. better pray for tomorrow. i did make a box for 선생님 tho, which was
fun. i also had to wash my underwear, for the last time. the washer was broken so i had to sweeze the water out by hand
to hang up to dry. when i told imo i needed them tomorrow, she offered to let me borrow her bra LOL so sweet of her haha
하지만 조금 이산해 ㅋㅋㅋ 
</p>

<p>
that afternoon jo also came by to pick up the hiking shoes and i didnt get to make her a gift in time....she also brought
tonkatsu which was so nice of her. i literally had a full meal before imo texted us that we were going out to eat.
we went out to eat at this jigae place, which was pretty yummy. we got 오짐어보금 and kimchi jigae, which were both yummy
altho the pork in the stew was really fatty and i couldnt eat it. the people also kept compilmenting us there LOL. 
</p>

<p>
we also watch the olympics swimming while there and korea got 4th in swimming despite being behind most of the race!
US then won the race! it was actually really enteratining, esp with kim giving us his loud and uncecessary commentary LOL
een the ppl next to us were giving mad side eye lol. but overall solid dinner.
