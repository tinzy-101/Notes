   - database system = database + software to manage database + apps w/ UI
	- database = repo of data
	- us db as dbms (database management system, w/ all software) and build apps onto 
	
	Relational Structures:
		- many db built on relational data model: structure, integrity, language
		- relation = relational model table w/ nonduplicate rows 
		  - row = record (tuple)
		  - column = single attribute of the record (attribute) 
		  - tables = describe relations b/w data to form a record
	
	Integrity Constraints: 
		- integrity constraint = condition that all legal values in table obey 
		   - e.g. domain constraint: allowed values for attributes 
		  		- specified with ints, floats, strings
				- can make attribute "null"
				- only 1 relation
			- e.g. primary key constraint: attributes to uniqely identify tuples in relations
				- superkey: (set of) attribute to identify relation
				- key: minimal superkey
				- primary key: one of candidate keys (bc many keys) designated by db designer 
			- e.g. foreign key constraint: set of attributes to define relationships b/w relations (diff tables) 
				-  a set of attrib = foreign key in a relation R that references another relation T if: 
					1. foreign key attribs have same domain as primary key in T
					2. nonnull value in foreign key attribs match primary key value in T

<div id="34.3 SQL"><h3 id="34.3 SQL" class="header"><a href="#34.3 SQL">34.3 SQL</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	- SQL = language to access relational database systems 
	  - can be used on any relational db system, including apache derby (dev using java)
	  - MySQL = popular db, use with java 
		 
	Download MySQL:
	 	1. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/
		2. go to MySQL Community Server + select correct OS
		3. download tarball
		4. $&gt; tar -xvf mysql-server_MVER-DVER_CPU.deb-bundle.tar 
			- MVER = MySQL version
			- DVER = linux distro version
			- CPU = type of processor 
			  - need to change these values!!! look in downloads folder 
		5. $&gt; sudo apt-get install libaio1 
			- extra library 
		6. $&gt; sudo dpkg-preconfigure mysql-community-server_*.deb 
			- will get popup to enter password for root
		
	Setup MySQL: 
		1. mysql -u root -p 
			- enter root password set above
			- if didn't set password, default password is nothing, use: 
			  - mysql -u root 
			- enter mysql console
		2. create user 'user'@'localhost' identified by 'password'; 
			- creates user "user" with password "password"
			- remember ur semicolons!! 
			  - if u forget, will get \n and prompt: "-&gt;" 
			  - no bueno, ctrl+C to get out
		3. grant select, insert, update, delete, create, create view, drop, execute, references on *.* to 'user'@'localhost';
			- permissions to "user" 
		4. grant all privileges on *.* to 'user'@'%' identified by 'password';
			- enable remote access of acct from any IP address
			- doesn't work right now, but can choose another IP address to sub for '%' to grant remote access there (need to test on orangepi) 
		5. exit 
			- exit mysql console
		6. mysql -V 
			- check version
			- done OUTSIDE mysql console (regular terminal)
		6. ctrl+l 
			- clear mysql terminal

	Default: mysql &amp; test databases 
		- mysql = tables w/ info abt server + users 
		  - meant for admin
		  - DON'T create tables in mysql db
		- test = db to store and create new db's 
	
	Create DB:
		1. mysql -uuser -ppassword 
			- don't forget leading -u and -p to indicate user and password!!
		2. create database javabook;
			- creates DB called javabook 
		3. use javabook;
			- switch into DB
		3.5 select database(); 
			- see current selected db
		4. source script.sql; 
			- run commands in script file, need to download
			- will create and init tables used in book
</pre>

<pre>
	1. create table Student(
		-&gt; SSID integer
		-&gt; firstName varchar(25)
		-&gt; );
	2. will enter arrow regions, enter each entry of table in and press enter 
		- if last line ends in semicolon, will exit arrow region
		- if make a mistake, need to restart whole command  
		  - instead, use .sql file
	3. SSID = attribute, integer = datatype stored in attribute 
	4. Datatypes: 
		- char(5) = 5 characters
		- varchar(50) = variable characters, but max 50
		- integer = integer
		- primary key = primary key
			- choose one of the attributes to be primary key to unique identify the table
			- e.g. choose ssn, b/c that is unique to everyone, while firstName isn't
	5. show tables; 
		- see what and where tables
	6. drop table Course;
		- permanently drop table 
	
	Using .sql file: 
		1. write out same sql code above in text editor to define table
		2. source path/to/myfile.sql 
			- runs script file 
		3. comments: 
			-- this is a comment

<span id="34.3 SQL-Manipulating Tables"></span><strong id="Manipulating Tables">Manipulating Tables</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	Basic Insert:
		1. Syntax to insert:
				insert into tableName [column1, column2, ..., column) 
					- NOTE: these cols are the attributes u defined when creating the table!
				values (value1, value2, ...,valuen); 
		2. Example to insert:
				insert into Course (courseId, subjectId) 
				values ('11113', 'CSCI');
		3. column names are optional
			- if omit, all col values still need to be entered 
		4. string values case sensitive + single quotes 
		5. desc tableName; 
			- list field, types, attributes, etc in table

	Updating:
		1. Syntax:	
				update tableName
				set column1 = newValue1 [, column2 = newValue2, ...]
				[where condition];
		2. Example: change "numOfCredits" to 4 for course called "Database Systems"
		      update Course 
				set numOfCredits = 4;
				where title = 'Database Systems';
			  
	Deleting:
		1. Syntax:
				delete from tableName
				[where condition]; 
		2. Example: delete course "Database Systems" from the Course table 
				delete from Course
				where title = 'Database Systems';
		3. Delete ALL records from Course table: 
				delete from Course;
				
	See changes:
		1. select * from tableName;
</pre>

<span id="34.3 SQL-Simple Queries"></span><strong id="Simple Queries">Simple Queries</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	Retrieving Info:
		1. Syntax:
				select column-list 
				from table-list
				where condition;
		2. Example: select all students in the CS department, will show their first, middle, last names 
				select firstName, mi, lastName
				from Student
				where deptId = 'CS';
	
	Operators:
		1. = - equal
		2. &lt;&gt; or != - not equal
		3. &lt;= - less than or equal
		4. &gt;= - greater than or Equal
		5. not - logical negation
		6. and - logical conjuction
		7. or - logical disjunction
	
	Operator Example:
		1. select firstName, mi, lastName
			from Student
			where deptId = 'CS' and zipCode = '31411';
		2. increases "filters" for info abt CS students
		3. can replace "firstName, mi, etc ...." with * to get all attributed 
	
	Other operators: 
		1. like: check if string "s" has pattern "p"
				s like p or s not like p 
		2. between-and: check if value "v" between values "v1" and "v2" 
				v between v1 and v2 
				v &gt;= v1 and v&lt;= v2
					- can combine with logical operators: v not between v1 and v2
		3. is null: check if value "v" is null 
				v is null 
			
	Column Alias: 
		1. select columnName as alias
			select lastName as "Last Name", zipCode as "ZipCode"
			from Student 
			where deptId = 'CS'
		2. will print table w/ column names as "Last Name" instead of "lastName" from table Student + extra filter for CS dept id
  
  Arithmetic Operators
  		1. select title, 50 * numOfCredits as "Lecture Minutes Per Week"
			from Course 
		2. will print the title of course + lecture minutes as a function of number of credits and label as lecture minutes

	Displaying Distinct Tuples
		1. select distinct subjectId as "Subject ID" 
			from Course;
		2. shows all subject Ids, but removes any duplicates 
		3. "distinct" will be applied to entire tuple:
			select distinct subjectId, title from Course;
				- if subjectId + title combo is unique, then show both
				- might have repeats in individual columns subjectId and title
	
	Displaying Sorted Tuples
		1. Syntax:
				select column-list 
				from table-list 
				where condition
				order by columns-to-be-sorted 
		2. Example:
				select lastName, firstName, deptId 
				from Student
				where deptId = 'CS'
				order by lastName desc, firstName asc; 
		3. What example does: 
			- show lastName, firstName, and deptId of members from table Student with a deptId 'CS'
			- sort the last names in descending order and first names in ascending order
		
	Joining Tables
		1. Example:
				select distinct lastName, firstName, courseId
				from Student, Enrollment
				where Student.ssn = Enrollment.ssn and 
				lastName = 'Smith' and fristName = 'Jacob' 
		2. What example does: 
			- pull records from both table Student and Enrollment
			- show lastName, firstName, and courseId of each record
			- only show records where the ssn, lastName, AND firstName attribute are the same
