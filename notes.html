<ol>
<li>
background: understanding climate change, how scientists sutdy climate change (3-6 objectives) 

<ul>
<li>
at the end of this lab, you should be able to (list objectives afterwards)

<li>
can adjust based on how lab writeup goes 

</ul>
<li>
some introduction (shorter or longer, some background info, motivation for the lab, abt 1/2 a page of background) 

<ul>
<li>
a few pararaphs on basic climate change, defining why its important to know abt cliamate change, how scientists study climate change, narrow into ice cores

<li>
natural climate change vs human induced climate change, just a few sentences (factors involved)

<li>
how scientsits study: lines of evidence (lake sediment, capturing of samples from atmosphere, and narrow into ice cores) --&gt; how theyve learned about historical climate patterns

<li>
next paragraph explains ice cores: where, how to extract, brief overview of how to use to study climate, some things u can determine (orbit change, volcanic activity)

<li>
use a graphic about historical temps and co2 levels (after talking about co2 and why its important, co2 is tracker of historic climate patterns)

<li>
bold key terms and define them

</ul>
<li>
for each exercise, have brief description 

<ul>
<li>
e.g. ex 1, using ice core to track co2 levels based on patterns in ice core

<li>
give step by step instructions (look at ice core, count num of ice cores, then calculate, steps)

<li>
have a table ready if theyd collecting data

<li>
qs at the end: e.g. why do u think co2 levels have changed

</ul>
<li>
todo 

<ul>
<li>
pick what to have students to look at th in the ice cores (cover in ice core)

<li>
think about what background info ppl would need

<li>
can also be background info for display at STEAM'D fest 

</ul>
</ol>
