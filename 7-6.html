Today we went to the DMZ! Sophie and I had to wake up at 5:30 to get there on time, our commute was only about 30 min
though, thankfully. 영애이모 woke up even earlier to make us breakfast, and she made some bomb french toast with cheese.
Almost life changing 
Also, we were so worried that we were gonna be late because the subway that picked us up wouldn't
close its doors LOL, we were ust sitting on an empty train too so we thought we were being stupid haha. 
So many people were late! We left pretty late, but a bus picked us up. As we were driving, we had
this really funny tour guide who would tells us stories and randomly monologue about his son and other things lol.
When drove into some visitor center with an amusement park lol, and that's where we bought the tickets. Then we went 
back to the bus and drove into the DMZ! We passed by a military check point and these 2 soldiers came in to check our
passports, was kinda funny. I also saw a Korean pheasant after the checkpoint, it was so beautiful!

After we got in, we visited this place where you could use binoculars to look into north korea. There were so many 
foreigners there, it felt like we were back in the US lol.

We went to this place where we could look through these binoculars and see into north korea. one lady positioned the
binoculars so we could see the north korean flag! Was pretty cool and surreal. The greenery was also so beautiful. 
Laryssa and I also found this photo-booth like thing where we could take pics with different backgrounds, it was so
cute. Jenny and Kyle also joined us later on :D

We also saw this tower that reminded me of the scene in the cult arc of Lookism where a man was hung on a cross,
especially with the barbed wire. Felt super uncanny.

Found this really nice plum drink + melon milk!

After that place, we headed to tunnel 3 that kim jeong un dug after the armistice in an attempt to invade south korea.
When questioned about the tunnel by the south koreans, apparently they tried to lie and say that it was a coal mine
by rubbing coal all over the tunnerl, despite having dug through granite XD. Nice try, buddy. That's also why we could 
see black remnants on the tunnel when we went in. 
The tunnel was super cold, and we also had to wear helmets to go in. We walked down this kinda steep walkway, and when 
we reached the bottom, there was spring water fountain, pretty cool and refeshing! Unfortunately we had to leave our 
phones outside in a locker, but the tunnel was a vibe. There was tons of dripping moss on the sides and felt so nice
and cool. We eventually came back out and headed to lunch.

We drove to this pretty traditional Korean restaurant where we had to take our shoes off before we went inside, and we 
all wore slippers together! I was happy cuz I could show off my totoro socks lolol. The food was also SO GOOD, with 
a whole plate of really nicely seasoned pork. There was also tons of 반찬, my favorite might be the potatoes, tofu,
and eggplant. Felt like I hadn't eaten that well in ages, despite 영애이모 always stuffing us with great food, like pigs.
Side note, her food combos are a lil weird sometimes.....toast + jam + 치즈 + 고추 + 토마토 + 오이 + blueberries lol.
HOWEVER her doengjang + gochujang + sesame oil combo is AMAZING, actually life changing. I will actually we taking that
recipe back to the US, esp eating that with cucumbers.

Anyways, after eating, we headed to a suspension bridge in the area. On the way over, after openly saying that Riize
sohee has bad vocals in front of Salene, she spent a good 10 min trying to convince me otherwise lol. Not to say that
they're bad, but just compared to DO....I showed her sohee vs DO's covers of 나였으면, and she go it lol. Just so much
more depth to DO's cover. After that, we spent pretty much the whole bus ride trading songs, and she gave me a whole
list of DO, exo, seventeen, nct, and SF9 songs to listen to. They're so good! So happy to have someone who appreciates
EXO and DO as much as I do...heavenly vocals. Side note, she was also the one who introduced me to 혜야, so I by default
trust her music taste haha. After talking abut the songs, I started listening to some of Laryssa's Ukrainian songs, which
I kepts accidentally calling Russian lol oops. I also showed her the Sweet Girl dance practice video which was so fucking
ridiculous, I love it so much. Esp the hand-sliding-down-knee motion. We definitely have to learn the choreo. 

Anyways, when we finally arrived at the suspension bridge, we had to go up a long flight of stairs, but the views were
absolutely insane, so green and beautiful. The suspension bridge was actually over a reservoir with tons of massive
carp waiting for us to feed them. On the way, Elena and I started talking to our guide and I asked him for Bukhansan
recommendations lol, he was actually not sure helpful but was fun to talk to him. The suspension bridge was 
acutally so beautiful. It kinda swung a lot, and I was almost scared that I would drop my stuff in, like my passport lol.
There was this pavilion thing at the other side, which was so pretty with lots of wind. We infiltrated it and kinda
smoked a Korean couple out lol. Then the bus picked us up and we drove back.

I fell asleep on the way back and it was so refreshing, esp while listening to music. DO's My Dear was just replaying
over and over again, it's literally my 4th most listened to song now; this is an unhealthy obsession but I love it..
just feels like a hug. 

After we arrived back at the station, Salene, Izzy, Ivy, Sophie, Tanisha, Elena, Laryssa and I decided to go to a nearby
uniqlo, where everything was so expensive...US prices fr. Even the Muji was expensive, I def caught a deal last time.

I went hope with Sophie after window shopping, and when we got back we ate dinner with 영애이모와김선생님, then
we went for a walk with 꿀떡. We stopped by a playground with harry potter in the background. There were so spinny 
pole thingys that were so fast, kinda a hazard for kids. What I imagine figure skaters felt like. So fun. We also went
on the wide frisbee-like spinny thingy, I was standing at first with Sophie then had to sit down. 영애이모 eventually
joined us and we all sat down going in circles, it was probably the highlight of the night. So fun :)) good vibes

After the walk, we just went home and went to sleep. I prepared for 아차산 and went to sleep. hehe
