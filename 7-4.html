Happy 4th of July!

Today's class we learned 2 new grammar points:
1. ~ㄹ/을게요 - promise (동사)
	I promise not to be late to class = 제가 수업에 늦지 않을 게요. 
2. ~(으)니까 - reasons for order, preposition, suggestion (동사/형용사)
	Because I'm busy today, let's go tomorrow = 오늘은 바빠나까 내일가요.
	
	Helpful tips:
	
	~니까 combos:
					~(으)세요?
	~(으)니까	+	~아/어 주세요?
					~ㄹ/을까요?
					~아/어요?
	
	All ways of saying: Bc of something (으니까 ending), please do something else
	
	If the question uses: ~ㄹ/을 까요? Answer using: ~아/어요 (normal present tense ending, but can be used for propositions)
	If the question uses: ~ㄹ/을 게요? Answer using: ~ㄹ/을게요 OR ~세요

Class was fun, didn't pass as slowly. 선생님 bought us all strawberry choco pies, they were amazing. Christin also imprinted a US flag on my notebook;
was an interesting day LOL. A bit too much patriotism.

After class, we went to the 3rd floor above the plaza, which always has amazingly cheap food. Chicken katsu and this bibim rice thing with 
spam and potatoes were only 4200 won!!! Portions were generous and delicious.

After lunch, we all went to the international studies building to wait for our supporters to come. After I had my one-on-one with Jennie,
I walked back to where Laryssa and Elena were sitting, and saw Lorna with this random 잘생기남자. Apparently they had made eye contact, waved,
then she just walked up to him to ask for his Kakao ID?? The confidence?? TF???? Actually insane that that worked....need to try that out sometime LOL

When our supporter finally came, 예은 didn't show up so 용은 had to deal with all 5 of us: Kaila, Alex, Mia, Salene, and I. We went to the same cafe as 
last week, Tom n Toms, and I got the Mango Yogurt smoothie. Bomb but definately too sweet lol. We started doing 聽寫 practice with her, where she'd
read out words and sentences and we'd spell it out. Kaila can't spell so they were lowk arguing with eachother. We also begged her to buy us this honey
butter bread that was SO GOOD. She was visibly fed up with us by the end...at 5 she just up and left.....wonder how the next session will be lol

After we finished with our supporters, I met up with Laryssa to go out to eat at McDonalds to celebrate 4th of July. On the way, we passed by Jason,
Slade, and AJ with their supporter. The supporter was actually so cute, very nice, with a perfect American English accent. Just adorable lol.
Legitimately thought he could've been from the US, he was that good. So nice that he stayed with the group for so long.

After dinner (I lowk got scammed; paid 2800 won for 2 miniscule chicken tenders) we went to hyu to plan bukhansan, then went back home. I went to songsu
park before going home, and there was just this massive shoe statue cause the district is known for shoes; there's actually shoes sold EVERYWHERE, it's kinda
cool. I went home hoping they'd already eaten dinner but that was stupid of me. My host mom basically forced to eat watermelon, kimchi jigae, and all the food
she made despite knowing I already at dinner lol, she's so sweet. Dinner was thankfully not as awk as yesterday tho lol, tho 김선생님 was still obssessed
with showing Sophie his American songs lollllll.........

Misc Tea:
1. apparently Slade is a misogynist and said that Kamala Harris should die if she becomes president? Also he stinks? Blessing + Kaila's
	friend group all think so, but I literally don't smell it?? Seems like they're saying that just to hate 
2. Jordan has been making really inappropraite jokes to all the guys, so Jason and Kunkel had to go tell Kyle and Jennie
3. Silvia is being ostrasized; blessing's group is lowk so mean to her. she's pretty naive and socially awkward, but I feel bad for her
4. L likes oreo???? WTF 

Farewell,

Tina 

7/4, technically the next day
