<ol>
<li>
container classes before have constant capacity, need to recompile if want a bigger size 

<ul>
<li>
if using dynamic arrays, can control size of independent bags, bc size is determined after program is running 

</ul>
<li>
pointer = address of variable 

<ul>
<li>
variable to store a pointer: double **pointer  

<li>
setting a pointer var to point to a double address: pointer = &amp;i;

<li>
print out object that pointer points to: cout &lt;&lt; **pointer; (dereferencing) 

<li>
modifying the pointer will also modify the object that it points to

</ul>
<li>
careful!! p1 = p2 IS NOT THE SAME AS **p1 = **p2

<ul>
<li>
p1 = p2 --&gt; make p1 point to the same variable that p1 is already pointing to

<li>
**p1 = **p2 --&gt; copy the value from the variable that p2 is pointing to to the variable that p1 points to 

<ul>
<li>
the values of p1 and p2 will not change (still point to the same location)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Dynamic Variables and New Operator 

<ul>
<li>
dynamic variables not declared (no identifier/name) + created during program execution

<li>
create using "new" operator 

<ul>
<li>
int **p1 = new int; --&gt; create a variable p1 that points to an int

<li>
can allocate a whole array using new, will return pointer to 1st component of array 

<ul>
<li>
int **p1 = new int[4];

<li>
p1[2] = 42;

<li>
this is a dynamic array! number of array components calculated when program running 

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
new allocates mem for dynamic var + return pointer to 1st part of allocated memory 

<ul>
<li>
if dynamic var is object of class --&gt; call default constructor, unless you give params:

<li>
throttle **p1 = new throttle(50);

<li>
vs just saying throttle **p1; --&gt; default constructor 

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Heap and bad_alloc exception 

<ul>
<li>
new allocated memory on the heap

<li>
new will fail using a "bad_alloc" exception

</ul>
<li>
delete 

<ul>
<li>
call "delete" on pointer variables when allocated using "new" to return mem back to heap 

<ul>
<li>
int **p;

<li>
delete p;

</ul>
<li>
delete dynamic array 

<ul>
<li>
int **p = new int[50];

<li>
delete [] p;

</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
<div id="4.2 Pointers and Arrays as Parameters"><h4 id="4.2 Pointers and Arrays as Parameters" class="header"><a href="#4.2 Pointers and Arrays as Parameters">4.2 Pointers and Arrays as Parameters</a></h4></div>
<ol>
<li>
value parameters that are pointers 

<ul>
<li>
pass in int **p1

<li>
inside function: **p1 = 42

<li>
we are dereferencing p1 to modify the int variable that p1 points to 

</ul>
<li>
array parameters 

<ul>
<li>
array param is treated like a pointer pointing to 1st element of array 

<li>
e.g. void append(double data[], size_t n)

<li>
usually size is separately declared 

</ul>
<li>
const params that are pointers or arrays 

<ul>
<li>
parameter that is pointer or array can also have const

<li>
e.g. void append (const int** p1) --&gt; p1 is a pointer to a constant integer  

<ul>
<li>
can change p1 but NOT **p1, the int that p1 points to 

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
reference parameters that are pointers 

<ul>
<li>
if you pass a pointer in by reference, can change the pointer to point to another location 

<li>
void allocate(double**&amp; p, size_t&amp; n) 

<ul>
<li>
allocates mem for a new dynamic array

<li>
p is a pointer to a double 

</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
<div id="4.3 Bag Class with a Dynamic Array"><h4 id="4.3 Bag Class with a Dynamic Array" class="header"><a href="#4.3 Bag Class with a Dynamic Array">4.3 Bag Class with a Dynamic Array</a></h4></div>
<ol>
<li>
class can be a dynamic data structure (size determined at runtime) 

<li>
pointer member variables 

<ul>
<li>
for dynamic bag, need a dynamic partially filled array: value_type **data 

<li>
there is no max capacity, but also need another var to keep track of how much mem is being allocated 

<ul>
<li>
member var "capacity" to show current capacity of bag (NOT const)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
invariant for new bag class 

<ul>
<li>
number of items in bag is stored in member variable "used"

<li>
the actual items of the bag are stored in a partially fileld dynamic array, "data"

<li>
total size of the dynamic array is stored in member variable "capacity"

</ul>
<li>
Member FUnctions 

<ul>
<li>
when class uses dynamic memory, class member functions allocated dynamic mem as needed

<li>
constructor of dynamic bag allocates dynamic array that "data" points to

<li>
want constructor to allocate an initial size passed in as a parameter to the constructor 

<ul>
<li>
this size can be updated, so everytime another element is added, e.g. using insert, check if size is big enough,

<li>
if not big enough, then allocate new, larger dynamic array and copy old stuff over 

<li>
use a larger initial capacity so dont have to bother keep going back to heap space and allocating new mem

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
constructor 

<ul>
<li>
bag(size_type initial_capacity = DEFAULT_CAPACITY) 

<li>
need to set initial capacity in the constructor

<li>
bc of the way its defined, you can also use this constructor definition for the default constructor, if no size

<li>
is given, then the initial capacity will just be the DEFAULT_CAPACITY that you define 

<li>
implementation:

<ul>
<li>
need to set up private member vars to satisfy invarian of the class

<li>
initialize data, capacity, and used 

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
reserve() 

<ul>
<li>
this member function changes the capacity of the current array/bag

<li>
i think this is the one where need to get new array and copy all the elements over? 

<ul>
<li>
YES - no other way to change the size of an array

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Value Semantics 

<ul>
<li>
value semantics = how values are copied from 1 bag to another (in assignemnt statements)

<li>
CAN'T use assignment operator (=) on a dynamic array/classes 

<ul>
<li>
when assigning y=x, both y and x will point to the same memoery, so same data, so changes to y will change x!

<li>
need to make overloaded assignment operator --&gt; NEEDS to be a member function (required by C++)

<li>
implementation:

<ul>
<li>
similar to the copy constructor

<li>
dont need to construct a new bag (already have partially filled array allocated)

<li>
need to check size of array, and might need to change array size and return og array to heap

<li>
do an initial check if source parameter (thing being copies) is same as object activating "="

<ul>
<li>
if(this == &amp;source) return;

</ul>
<li>
this --&gt; pointer to to object that activated the "=" operator, which is why we need to compare it to 

<li>
&amp;source rather than just source

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
when using copy constructor, e.g. bag y(x), need to add a prototype: 

<ul>
<li>
bag(const bag&amp; source);

<li>
this will make sure NOT ONLY member variables are copied over

<li>
implementation:

<ul>
<li>
capacity of dynamic array is same as capacity of abg that is being copied

<li>
initialize data, capacity, used, then copy contents from 1 bag to another

<li>
use copy() from algorithms: copy(source.data, source.data + used, data);

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Destructor 

<ul>
<li>
need to return object's dynamic memory to the heap 

<li>
no parameters and no return value + need to write empty param list 

<ul>
<li>
~bag()

</ul>
<li>
destructor is typically automatically activated 

<ul>
<li>
if a function has a local variable that is object of a class, when returning from the function destructor called

<li>
if function has value parameter that is obejct, when function returns destructor is called

</ul>
<li>
implementation:

<ul>
<li>
only have: delete [] data;

</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
<div id="Prescription for a Dynamic Class"><h4 id="Prescription for a Dynamic Class" class="header"><a href="#Prescription for a Dynamic Class">Prescription for a Dynamic Class</a></h4></div>
<ol>
<li>
4 rules when classes use dynamic memory 

<ul>
<li>
some member variables are pointer

<li>
members functions allocate and release dynamic memory as needed

<li>
automatic value semantics of the class are overridden (NEED assignment operator and copy constructor)

<li>
class has destructor (release all dynamic mem to heap)

</ul>
</ol>
