Transportation: 

Option 1: 
Better for get off at Ui Ranger Station on the east --&gt; get off at Bukhansan Ui Station exit 2,
make a left and will see a CU. Hike up for 40 min (no bus), need to get to the ranger station
Will eventually get to Doseonsa Temple (halfway up the mountain), where trail officially starts
Recommended to go see Doseonsa temple, then go back to parking lot and look for 백운대, tallest 
peak on the mountain range. 

Things that you'll pass by:
1. police mountain rescue hut
2. insubond, one of Bukhansan's 3 horns
3. stone shelter
4. wimun gate (steep climb before top)

Option 2:
Line 3 to Gupabal station, exit 1 to bus stop, take buss # 704 to 북한산성 bus station.
Will be lots of restaurants and gear shops. Find park headquarters for maps and trailhead.
Will start by small river, but will eventually leave river and trail gets steep.

Things you'll pass by:
1. river, then steep forest only
2. long flight of wooden steps up to Wimun gate, then turn left for final section
3. leave the forest, and climb up granite slabs at summit

If doing BOTH options:
Start from Gupabal and finish at Ui, might be too much tho
