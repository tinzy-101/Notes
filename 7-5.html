Option 2:
Line 3 to Gupabal station, exit 1 to bus stop, take buss # 704 to 북한산성 bus station.
Will be lots of restaurants and gear shops. Find park headquarters for maps and trailhead.

3. leave the forest, and climb up granite slabs at summit

If doing BOTH options:
Start from Gupabal and finish at Ui, might be too much tho

	Today in class we just did a bunch of role playing with different situations, like how to order things at a cafe
	and order things for delivery, was pretty fun. We also had lunch with 선생님! It was really fun, we got to eat
	chicken sandwiches, and also got some extra kimbap because oreo was being annoying as hell about his shrimp allergy,
	and refused to eat the veggie kimbap. The teriyaki kimbap was pretty bomb tho. 선생님 also had a bunch of snacks for
	us, they were all pretty sweet tho, unfortunately.

	After lunch, we headed over to the station exit to get on the bus to go to taekwondo! It was a fun day, we practiced
	more kicks like roundhouse and side, and lined up to kick these bags like in MMA. One of the TAs was a black belt
	candidate, and he looked like he was 15 max, omg. Also the walls are covered with these pics of kids that are 2nd
	or 3rd degree black belts, but they're all so young, like 12 max....So funny LOL makes u wonder how legit the place
	is. The teacher also doesn't really teach how to do the technique like in MMA or karate, he just demonstrates it and
	doesn't really explain the mechanics of it, like where the strike should land. Still fun tho. We also had to do this 
	ab exercise where we'd lay down, hold our partner's legs and lift our legs up and down as a core workout.

	After class, Elena Laryssa and I went to namsan! It was a short bus ride away but super fun. When we got to the trail
	head, we were about to make the 1 hr trek up to the tower until we realized that we could just take the bus up. The 
	bus was so cute, it was pink with this furry monster guy all over the walls haha. And lowk the bus ride up was such 
	a highlight, we were going up so fast and just sliding around, it was like a rollercoaster. The views were also so
	beautiful, so much more green than anywhere else in Seoul. The walk up to the tower was short, and there were tons
	of picture taking places (as youll soon see below....) and lots of romantic areas too. We stopped by the gift shop and
	I got NJ bandaids for chris lol. We didn't go up the tower cause it was expensive, and the views were great enough
	on their own. We walked around the pavilion outside and and took some group photos, was super fun haha.
	Then we went down and took the bus back home. When I tried to get off at my stop, I tapped my card out, but realized
	that I hadn't pressed the button to signal the driver to stop LOLL. So i just stood there by the doors like a dumbass
	waiting for them to open. I ended up having to get off at the next stop and walk back. It was a nice walk tho, lots
	of skyscrapers.

	When I finally got back home, 영에이모, 꿀떡, and Jo were sitting at the 명동자리. I joined them, and we starting
	talking about going to Bukhansan. Apparently Jo's husband and whole family really love hiking (they hiked the JMT
	last year, took 13 days!! passed thru yosemite too). Apparently 영애이모 has been really worried about Laryssa and I 
	going to Bukhansan, Jo offered to go with us and her husband! She also wants to let me borrow her daughter's hiking
	shoes, which are US size 7 and korea size 8. I tried Jo's size 7 shoe on in the street and it surprisingly fit lol. 
	We also exchanged numbers ^^ So freaking nice!! 
	
	After we finished talking, we went back home and because Sophie was at her play we could go out to eat chicken! 
	We walked to a place near the apartment and 김선생님 joined us later. There were some really delicious 
	circle cracker thingies. We ordered this fish cake soup and chicken, which was super delicious. She kept insisting
	that I try more sauce. Also, she ordered me coke after I told her no 3 times. And she drank beer for the first time
	in front of me with 김선생님, and made me try some lol. Disgusting. When we were walking back, she kept saying she was
	drunk and was a little wobbly lolll. Also, 김선생님 kept telling me I eat so well +  HALLELUJAH + GOOD BODY, and when
	he finished eating, he just got up, paid the bill and stood across the street watching us lmao. 
	
	When we got home, 김선생님 as always locked himself in his room, and 영애이모 and I took MBTI tests together!
	I ended up with INFJ, which I think is pretty accurate, and ENFP, which apparently are super compatible ones, so yay.
	She also drew a cute lil diagram to show our compatibility: me, Sophie, her, and 쿨로's mom, Jo
	us! She tried to get 김선생님 to take the MBTI test, but he lowk started yelling at her....was weird. She actually
	looked so embarassed of him afterwards.

	Was a really fun and adventure filled day! lots of new things.
