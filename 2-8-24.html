Test: 
processes, threads, synchronization issues, process scheduling, deadlocks
graphic deadlock reduction, multilevel feedback queue, monitor (different rules and different processes), process state transition diagram (7 state, 10 transitions, 3 schedulers), safe state
</p>

<p>
process state transition diagram: 
long term scheduler: new --&gt; ready (determines if process is active or not)
short term dispatcher: which one in ready queue executes next
intermediate/swapper: swaps processes out in disk back and forth into memory (to give other processes some CPU space)
</p>

<p>
Process scheduling algorithms: be aware of what they do 
FCFS, SJF, priority, round robin, multilevel feedback queue
look at picture and know what it is
