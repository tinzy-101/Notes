<pre>
	- happens when nothing happening on memory address line
	- something in CPU keeps track of data being moved into mem from external device

</p>
<pre>
	- have many different devices (character streams, sync/async, sharable/dedicated, read/write)
	- OS has control management modules + I/O subsys that work with diff structures in ur files
	- I/O evices: block, character, mem-mapped, network sockets

	- usually block until I/O is complete

</p>
<pre>
	- contiuous logical address space
	- 2 types of data stored: human readable text data + binary 
	  - diff from book

<span id="Chapter 13: File System Interface-File Attrib"></span><strong id="File Attrib">File Attrib</strong>

<span id="Chapter 13: File System Interface-File Operations"></span><strong id="File Operations">File Operations</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- file = abstract data type
	- operations: create, write (at write pointer), read (at read pointer), reposition, delete, truncate, open, close 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="Chapter 13: File System Interface-Open File"></span><strong id="Open File">Open File</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	- open file table = track open tables 
	- can lock an open file 
	  - shared lock = many can use
	  - exclusive lock = only 1 can use 
</pre>
<p>
<span id="Chapter 13: File System Interface-File System Organization"></span><strong id="File System Organization">File System Organization</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	1. directory 
		- operations, search, create, delete file, etc
		- single level, two level, tree structure
	2. partition A (bunch of files)
	3. directory
	4. partition B (bunch of files) 
	
	- can mount FS as long as host system can support the fs type 
	- can set up file sharing across network
	- need to protect files (read, write, exec, list, delete) 
	  - e.g. access lists on windows 
</pre>

<div id="File Organizations: ON TEST"><h3 id="File Organizations: ON TEST" class="header"><a href="#File Organizations: ON TEST">File Organizations: ON TEST</a></h3></div>
<pre>
	- use file allocation table (FAT)
	- each file is allocated blocks
	- 12 bit table, 2^12= 4096, max size partition = 2GB for FAT12 
	 
	How it works
	1. File1.txt has pointer to 2, 2 has pointer to 4, 4 points to 4, 4 points to 6, 6 points to 7, 7 points to end of file 
	2. MyDir points to 3 (in FAT index), 3 points to 5, 5 points to 5, 5 points to EOC (end of file)	
	In Dir Entry
	1. see file and starting block of file (e.g. File1.txt starts in block 2 of the FAT index)

<pre>
	1. In debug: 1 0 1 0 100 (address, drive, first sector, number of sectors u wanna read) 
	2. Dump mem, can see FAT table on disk 
		- shows allocation of disk's sectors 
		- are 2 copies, in case 1 gets corrupted 
	3. type in different sectors to see contents of different files 
		- e.g. sector 35 (hex=4600) has contents of file 2 
	4. type attrib: to see directory items
