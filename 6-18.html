Today Grace and I woke up at 5am to get packed and ready to leave for the airport. We got to the hotel lobby after a long wait for the elevator, and were surprisingly the first ones there lol, even before the staff. We were able to get some breakfast from the hotel when it opened at 6am, and I got a very nice and cheesy quiche, some scrambled eggs, and some sausages that were too salty, I also got a muffin togo that is still sadly sitting in my backpack lol. Our flight departed at 10:25 AM, but we got there around 3 hours early. TSA was a bit scary because my backpack got flagged; turns our the xian cao jelly counts as a spreadable item, and it was over the allowed sizes. 
After we got through security, I went wandering with Elena through the airport; she bought a lot of snacks just to finish off her stipend. I was contemplating getting the beef jerky but a tiny bag was \(14; I'd rather save the \)50 stipend to exchange into Korean won to spend. After wandering around and looking at all the airplanes in diff gates, and also running into a monster line of NSLI-Y kids at Peet's Coffee, we ended up back at G3, our correct terminal, which we had to go down an escalator to get to. We just sat around after that, and I folded one unit for my origami for my host family (I have 60 units to fold before sunday, when we meet our host parents). Soon enough, they started boarding and we all excitedly got onto te plane, taking tons of selfies.
The actual flight was around 12.5 hours and pretty rough. I tried to sleep, and got about 30 minutes in before I woke up. There was 3 groups of seats, ABC, DEF, GHI, and just my luck, I ended up in 57E, straight in the middle. I was constantly angling my head to the left or right to capture some pics. The plane also had some interesting window tint situation that made all the windows on the right look purple when dark, and all the windows on the left look green. I ended up watching 4 movies to pass the time:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Decision To Leave: kinda heart wrenching movie, some parts I didn't quite understand, especially how the 2 MCs came to love eachother. The ending was pretty sad though, with 소래 committing suicide with the camera that held the evidence of her murdering her husband (the male MC told her to throw it in the sea, so she threw herself in with it). The way she chose to die is most interesting to me, beause she dug a hole by the sea, and waited for the tide to wash in and fill up the hold to drown/suffocate her. Must've taken a lot of mental strength the stay down.

<li>
Kingsman: An absolutely classic, I totally remember being so obssessed with this movie; it was probably because I wanted the stuff that the Kingsmen had, like the umbrella gun. Still a very exciting plot line, especially with the different tests that Eggy had to go through. Was nice to rewatch (was between this and Top Gun), tho I probably won't watch again for a whie just cause the plot is so memorable, but not in the best way. More like in the way that a song gets stuck in your head, regardless of how annoying it is.

<li>
One Last Chance: Probably one of my favorite movies, gives me the same vibes as 少年的你, very sad and gut wrenching, but it ends happily. The first half of the movie I was laughing so much at the realationship between yeung and his dad, especially the moment when Water (dad) tells yeung that he can hit him back with his belt, but yeung ends up hitting his back with a glass bottle, giving them matching head bandages. I love when their relationship started developing, and yeung slowly stopped wearing his headphones, started eating food other than ramen, and let water touch him. It was also veyr sweet to see Water letting him in and genuinely caring for him. Honestly felt like Water did more for helping yeung developing into a capable and independent adult in Macau society in a month than his mother was able to do in all her years. It was so heartbreaking (I cried in the dark) when yeung's mother died of stomach cancer, but the regrowth arc where both walter and yeung get into running was so heartwarming and inspiring (I need to go run; hopefully I can go in seoul?? But from what ive seen so far it's been super smoggy). Also the ending song as they spread yeung's mom's ashes into the desert was so good, I think it's called 一天一天. TBH I kinda started the series cause yeung's actor was cute in the beginning LOLLL. Easily one of the most emotion-evoking movies I've watched in a long time. Maybe being on a plane helped??

<li>
The last movie I got halfway into was Suzume; THE ANIMATION IS FREAKING AMAZING, THE NATURE LOOKS SO BEAUTIFULLLL, I hope one day I can create computer graphics that look like that. I got to the point where Souta is turned solid and becomes the guardian key; I really hope that suzume is able to save him. Also is it a romance?? I can't really tell. One day I will finish it! It seemed a bit repetitive in the first hour with constantly stopping the worm from falling, but I liked the mom lore sprinkled into it. 

</ol>

For the last hour of the flight, I was just talking with Grace about how excited we were and about how similar our cats were (her cat's name is Mimi, and he's adorable). We flew over japan, but unfortunately couldn't see anything. When we finally landed, the air was immediately much warmer, but surprisingly not as hot and humid as I expected it to be; definitely less than in Taiwan. One thing I immediately noticed was how muggy everything was with smog. Also, so many people smoked and vaped on the streets, I was not expecting that.
We got onto 2 buses and drove to the Intercity Seoul hotel, which is super nice! It's significantly smaller than the one in SF, and some ppl got triples while Grace and I still got a double. There was actually a step for us to remove outside shoes and put on slippers, which I almost tripped over. Also, because I was figuring out the whole Kako talk situation with Kyle, Grace went up alone first and I went after. I didn't realize you need a key card to access the elevator, so I got lost on the second floor LOL. Luckily, this really nice Korean girl, with amazing english, was able to help me get to the 5th floor where my room was. Don't think I'll ever see her again, but so so so grateful. 
After settling into the room, we athered at 6:40 to head to a restuarant to eat dinner. We went down an alleyway-looking place and climbed many flights so stairs to get to a hotpot place!!! It was delicious, so many meats and all you could eat sides. I sat with Laryssa, Elena, and Adela, and we were just talking about all the different Korean signs outside, recognizing the hospitals, the gyms, and the singing practice rooms. So excited to visit all of those <sup><small>-</small></sup> After we finished up our dinner, we headed to a nearby GS25 to get drinks! I got strawberry milk and Laryssa unknowingly got a caramel milk, which tasted like flan. Both were amazing!! I kept some of the leftovers in the fridge. Also, when we were walking around to get to GS25, everything was so beautiful at night. All the lights were on and the buildings were so tall. So, so, so amazing. So excited to (hopefully) explore around outside the hotel.

Side note: Throughout the day, it was weird how little direction we got. We were lead from hotel to restuarant to eat dinner without knowing much about what we were doing next. When we ate hotpot, Elena was allergic to eggs and had to ask if a lot of thins had eggs in it, and we all felt like it would've been nice to have more direction, especially for the people who haven't eaten hot pot yet. Hopefully the rest of the stay they're going to be more explicit about things, but we'll see. We are 40 kids vs 3 adults (kyle, yeonjin, and minnie), which can be crazy to manage, so its pretty impressive that they pulled it off.

Can't wait for tomorrow!! Aparently we have a super packed schedule so we'll see haha.
