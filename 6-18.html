Today Grace and I woke up at 5am to get packed and ready to leave for the airport. We got to the hotel lobby after a long wait for the elevator, and were surprisingly the first ones there lol, even before the staff. We were able to get some breakfast from the hotel when it opened at 6am, and I got a very nice and cheesy quiche, some scrambled eggs, and some sausages that were too salty, I also got a muffin togo that is still sadly sitting in my backpack lol. Our flight departed at 10:25 AM, but we got there around 3 hours early. TSA was a bit scary because my backpack got flagged; turns our the xian cao jelly counts as a spreadable item, and it was over the allowed sizes. 
After we got through security, I went wandering with Elena through the airport; she bought a lot of snacks just to finish off her stipend. I was contemplating getting the beef jerky but a tiny bag was \(14; I'd rather save the \)50 stipend to exchange into Korean won to spend. After wandering around and looking at all the airplanes in diff gates, and also running into a monster line of NSLI-Y kids at Peet's Coffee, we ended up back at G3, our correct terminal, which we had to go down an escalator to get to. We just sat around after that, and I folded one unit for my origami for my host family (I have 60 units to fold before sunday, when we meet our host parents). Soon enough, they started boarding and we all excitedly got onto te plane, taking tons of selfies.
The actual flight was around 12.5 hours and pretty rough. I tried to sleep, and got about 30 minutes in before I woke up. I ended up watching 4 movies to pass the time:

Decision To Leave: kinda heart wrenching movie, some parts I didn't quite understand, especially how the 2 MCs came to love eachother. The ending was pretty sad though, with 소래 committing suicide with the camera that held the evidence of her murdering her husband (the male MC told her to throw it in the sea, so she threw herself in with it). The way she chose to die is most interesting to me, beause she dug a hole by the sea, and waited for the tide to wash in and fill up the hold to drown/suffocate her. Must've taken a lot of mental strength the stay down.

<li>
Kingsman: An absolutely classic, I totally remember being so obssessed with this movie; it was probably because I wanted the stuff that the Kingsmen had, like the umbrella gun. Still a very exciting plot line, especially with the different tests that Eggy had to go through. Was nice to rewatch (was between this and Top Gun), tho I probably won't watch again for a whie just cause the plot is so memorable, but not in the best way. More like in the way that a song gets stuck in your head, regardless of how annoying it is.
