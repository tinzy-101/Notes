shred paper files

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
phases of data analysis process and data life cycle are NOT the same! 

<ul>
<li>
data lifecycle is generic framework for how data managed

<li>
diff depts of government use slightly difference life cycles e.g. some focus more on historical data

<li>
universal data management principle: govern how data is handled so is accurate, secure, and available to analysts

</ul>
</ol>

<li>
clean, transform, combine data, remove outliers/inconsistencies

</ul>
<li>
analyze
