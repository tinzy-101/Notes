<ol>
<li>
sociological perspective/imagination 

<ul>
<li>
individual person connected to wider society

<li>
concentric circles, inside out: 

<li>
individual (statuses and roles) -&gt; small groups (fam, friends, etc) -&gt; institution (fam, school) -&gt; society

<ul>
<li>
status = something earned (degree) or something born with (race)

<li>
roles = expected behavior from a person with a status

<li>
small groups: ppl act differently depending on which group they are in 

<li>
institution = ppl that come together for a common purpose 

<ul>
<li>
govern behaviors and expectations of individuals

<li>
durable

<li>
have a defined goal w/ function to meet needs of society

<li>
defining characteristic: hierarchy and written rules governing roles/expectations

<li>
e.g. at home mike is a son, at school mike is a student (roles)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
social structure runs across diff levels of society

</ul>
<li>
social structure 

<ul>
<li>
defines how society is arranged 

<ul>
<li>
society includes individual, small groups, institutions

</ul>
<li>
structure = pattern of stable relations from repeated interactions b/w individuals that determine certain actions 

<ul>
<li>
e.g. US economic structure = individuals enter labor contracts

<li>
when there are "structural economic changes" = changes in pattern of relations among workers, managers, employers, caused by the sectoral/technological/legal changes

<li>
e.g. network structure = pattern of ties among nodes in network

</ul>
<li>
once an individual become part of a structure, they have constrained actions

<li>
e.g. of social structures 

<ul>
<li>
eating and business open/close times, arrangement of labor, care for the young (marriage and kinship)

</ul>
<li>
social structures are objective --&gt; exist independently of individuals 

<ul>
<li>
dynamic and not natural (made up by individuals and will evolve over time)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
components of social structure 

<ul>
<li>
upside down triangle, top to bottom:

<li>
social institutions (complex social forms that reproduce themselves) -&gt; social groups (networks of individuals bound by relationships) -&gt; social status (position in society)

<li>
all of these tiers are interconnected and impact individual behavior

<li>
same as circular diagram

</ul>
<li>
social structure and human agents 

<ul>
<li>
individuals have choices but they are structurally constrained by: available choices, social rules telling rank order and appropriateness of choices

<li>
social stratificiation is a social structure 

<ul>
<li>
social (not natural)

<li>
made up by humans

<li>
constrain and enable human behavior

<li>
exist independently of individuals

<li>
dynamic 

</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
		 
<div id="Stratification-Defintions"><h3 id="Defintions" class="header"><a href="#Stratification-Defintions">Defintions</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
introductory diagram 

<ul>
<li>
human differences (basis of) -&gt; social differentiation (and power) &lt;-&gt; social indequality &lt;-&gt; social stratification

</ul>
<li>
human differences 

<ul>
<li>
natural and biological: physique, strenght, hair/skin color

<li>
social and cultural: work, religion, music taste, citizenship

<li>
every human unique in some way

</ul>
<li>
social differentiation 

<ul>
<li>
attaches meanings to human differences

<li>
involves process of making ppl different

<li>
e.g. meanings of being a teacher vs a student 

<ul>
<li>
obvi teachers are diff to students because they teach and student listens/learns

<li>
the important part is that because of this difference, teacher can direct/control behavior of student

</ul>
<li>
belief system = mental map that tells us how to interact w/ the world 

<ul>
<li>
e.g. if someone tells us they gave birth to baby girl, use mental map to figure out how what baby, girl, and birth mean 

<ul>
<li>
figure out the ideas involved using stock of ideas we have already learned thru socialization

<li>
e.g. concept of girl vs concept of boy has different meanings to diff people

</ul>
<li>
e.g. student teacher differences 

<ul>
<li>
diff values: student should obey teacher

<li>
diff norms: when teacher talking, dont talk

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
sociologists care about what human differences mean and how they impact views of ourselves and others

</ul>
<li>
social inequality 

<ul>
<li>
when power is used to put into practice ideologies and social differentiation, and creating conditions where diff social groups have unequal access to resources --&gt; social inequality

<li>
emerges from social differentiation for 2 reasons: 

<ul>
<li>
human judgement: ppl judges what's good and bad (esp for behaviors)

<li>
roles or social positions: some roles place ppl in position to get more valued goods/services 

<ul>
<li>
e.g. values of strength, family legacy, etc

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
2 types of social inequality 

<ul>
<li>
material inequaltiy: economic inequalities bw ppl

<li>
symbolity ineuality: status differences, power (some ppl have more control over life chances)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
social stratification 

<ul>
<li>
when social inequality is structurally embedded in society (exists everywhere over time) --&gt; social inequaltity creates a social hierarchy

<li>
system of social realtionsips determining who gets what and why

<li>
this process of inequality --&gt; hierarchy = social stratification

<li>
strata = layer

<li>
to strata = ability to arrange in strata (social grades)

<li>
individuals can be assigned to levels in society they live in

<li>
social strat is a good starting point to analyze human social relationships

<li>
formal def: 

<ul>
<li>
social strat = structured inequalities between diff groupings of ppl

<li>
hierarchical system of inequallity (material and symbolic), supported by meaning system that justifies inequality

</ul>
<li>
2 key concepts: 

<ul>
<li>
hierarchy 

<ul>
<li>
symbolic/literally groups are arranged

<li>
e.g. by prestige, wealth, education

</ul>
<li>
systematic 

<ul>
<li>
intentional, exists for a reason

<li>
rules for distribution of limited resources

<li>
some benefit, some suffer 

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
</ol>
			
<div id="Stratification-Systems of Social Stratification"><h3 id="Systems of Social Stratification" class="header"><a href="#Stratification-Systems of Social Stratification">Systems of Social Stratification</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
systems can be characterized as open or closed 

<ul>
<li>
closed system: 

<ul>
<li>
ascribed status, ppl cant do much to change their social standing

<li>
e.g. have endogamous marriage --&gt; marry ppl w similar social statuses

</ul>
<li>
open system: 

<ul>
<li>
achieved status, ppl move freely thru diff statuses

<li>
e.g. can have exogamous marriage --&gt; marry ppl w/ diff statuses

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
systems of soc strat: slavery 

<ul>
<li>
initially based on debt, punishment, law --&gt; open system ("earn" being a slave, can get out by paying debt)

<li>
in early US 1619-1865, bc of skin color ppl made slave --&gt; becomes closed system

<li>
who: masters and slaves

<li>
where: asia, europe, americas, africa

</ul>
<li>
systems of soc strat: caste 

<ul>
<li>
status determined by birth/family --&gt; closed

<li>
who: upper powerful group, and lower less poewrful groups

<ul>
<li>
e.g. in india is abolished, but still impacts society, 4 main castes w/ subcasts

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
systems fo soc strat: class 

<ul>
<li>
based on possession of achieved statuses (money, education, occupation) --&gt; open system

<li>
who: several classes

<li>
where: many modern societies

</ul>
<li>
systesm of soc strat: meritocracy 

<ul>
<li>
based on belief that social strat is result of personal merit --&gt; open system

<li>
ideal system

<li>
who: hierarchy of many social positions

<li>
where: never existed

</ul>
<li>
in US: have classs system 

<ul>
<li>
BUT its harder and harder to move upwards

</ul>
</ol>
<div id="Stratification-Summary"><h3 id="Summary" class="header"><a href="#Stratification-Summary">Summary</a></h3></div>
<ol>
<li>
soc strat made up of: 

<ul>
<li>
broad &amp; different social groups

<li>
hierarchical social groups

<li>
inequality

<li>
power

<li>
ideology

</ul>
<li>

carried thru generations --&gt; takes a long time to change (e.g. slavery)

<li>
universal and variable --&gt; every society has it and its diff everywhere

<li>
NOT just inequality --&gt; also beliefs! (ideology) --&gt; beliefs associated w/ human differences VERY important
