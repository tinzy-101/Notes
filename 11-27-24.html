<li>
representing vertices: vector of vector of 

<li>
representing edges: vector of vector of pointers to edge objects

<li>
BFS: breadth first search 

<ul>
<li>
can choose any vertex as starting point, go level by level to reach every vertex

<li>
first root of resulting search tree, then all children of root, then all grandchildren of root from left to right

</ul>
<li>
degree (of vertex) = number of edges incident on a vertex

<li>
BFS ON FINAL 

<ul>
<li>
tell contents of parents parray, visited bool array, search order

<li>
will need source code on the test to know order in which nodes are traversed (starting root node, which order to visit your children in) 

<ul>
<li>
on final: will always visit children smallest to largest (index: 0 -&gt; 1 -2 -&gt; etc)

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
applications of BFS: 

<ul>
<li>
if num vertices searched = num vertices in graph, graph = connected

<li>
can find a cycle in the graph

<li>
finding shortest path between 2 vertices 

</ul>
</ol>
