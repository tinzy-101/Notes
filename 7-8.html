Today was a snacking day. Had mushrooms, these sweet potato thingies, and another pack of bhocolate mushrooms after 
lunch...it was kinda bad but also so good. Lunch was this really good rice + potato + tofu thing, kinda like bibimbap,
with this meat as a side dish that was pretty sweet. Really bomb for being only 4200 won, as always :D

After lunch, we headed to tutoring where we finally got our shirts! They look so washed out lol but still really cute,
I love the design on the back, and I'm so excited to wear it hehe. Feels so iconic, especially after getting the virtual
nsliy shirt haha. Jennie and Kyle also surprised all of us with ice cream cubes! It was so cool, there were so many
different flavors separated by hershey chocolate squares. I ate 3 different flavors and got some chocolate too, was bomb

After we finished off there, we separated into our respective rooms to actuall start tutoring. Somehow we started talking
about a book that Alyssa was reading and annotating for her friend. some of the scenes were actaully so graphic it was
insane lol, me and laryssa were laughing our asses off. so funny to imagine that someone as stoic as alyssa would be 
reading that haha. 

After tutoring, where I did very ltitle studying, Laryssa and I decided to go wander around and finally look at the stem
buildings. Along the way, we found really cute grafiti....totally different vibes from grafiti i've seen in the US LOLL

We first went to the chemE building which was so cool! All of the labs had clear windows so we could really clearly see 
the labs and all the work that they were doing.....felt like a totally legit research uni, so unike the labs at WVC loll
하지만 괜찮아요~~~웨스트발리대학교를 청말 좋아해요 &lt;3 There were also some pretty cool displays of a motor and stuff.
Tons of guys too lol, as expected. The research posters were actually so funny to read acuse it looks like people didn't 
even bothr
