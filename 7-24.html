today in class it was still super hot and muggy, and i felt even more tired than usual in class, it was really bad.
during break i gave in and had 참치마요 onigiri, and it was bomb as usual. I didnt a get a drink tho, tho i was 
seriously contemplating the green tea latte. yay for self control haha 
during class kunkel wouldnt stop singing the meghan thee statllion japanese song that goes "watashi was star, kira kira"
and it was so freaking bad omg, made me actually want to kill myself. after talking about sophie yesterday, i actually
heard more than ever how much she uses 있어요 and how weird her enunciation on some words can bb. teacher could def
see how tired we were because she let us of pretty easy today. also, lately so many people have been late, at least 1 every day; its kinda bad
after class, we went to the cafeteria to get the cheese katsu, first time trying it and it was so good omg, the mozarella
cheese was so american lol. too busy monching to yap lol. we then went to tutoring where i was once again unproductive
me and ivy got the 2+1 deal on the matcha kicker bar tho and it was actually fire, would definately get again. We 
shared our extra one with izzy bc she didnt buy it cause her credit card got deactivated.....
after we did tutoring we went to the hanyang merch store and it was actually not that great bc of how small it was; 
pretty disappointing cause it was expensive; i lowk want to get a t shirt if i have money left over tho, only about 
15000 won. after the merch store, we went on this pretty fruitless run to find the bakery on campus bc salene really 
wanted it, but i eventually gave up lol cause it was so hot, sweat was literally pouring out of us. ivy looked so sad and
sweaty lol. we made it to the subway station, and decided to go to lotte world mall again instead of gangnam, and on the
way me and laryssa were talking about our gay friends, and how one of my friends is kinda trans and kinda gay LOL and 
invited me to urugay lolll. 
when we got their we went back to the totoro store! i was still super tempted by the totoro lunch bag, but saw that it 
was too small to actually fit anything, so I ended up getting a  7k won totoro key chain, and am pretty satisfied, 
i kinda wanna put it on my black school backpack hehe. we went to h&amp;m after, then to olive young, where i was honestly
pretty bored, so i decided to dip. i wandered around and found this surprisingly deep book store, and was realy tempted
to buy some books, but wasn't able to find The Vegetarian. I went down another floor and found a uniqlo, and there 
were honestly some pretty good prices for basic shirts, but i felt like i had to go back to 아름다운가게 before I could
buy some more new shirts...hopefully tomorrow hehe. then i decided to go to 왕십리 and buy some stuff in emart, but i 
got lost on the way out...still idk which exit there is to get to the emart omg. i ended up walking out of a random 
exit and came out to  pretty empty street. at that moment, 이모 texted us telling that we had to be back by 6:30 to go
to a famous restaurant, so i just went to the 7-11 right in front of the station and got a melon 우유, it was so 
delicious hehe. 
I then went home and met 이모 on the 22nd floor coming down the elevator (#2203#6463 building 103, 3-4), which was such
a funny coincidence, we went on a walk 하고 꿀뗙 where she told me we were going to a famoud galbi place in 뚝섬 bc
kim suddenly wanted to eat meat lol. she was happy cause she didnt have to cook tonight. We ended up only leaving at 
7pm, and by them kim decided to go to the restaurant and wait by himself lmao, so we were waaiting for him for nothing.
we all rushed home to take the subway there, and we finally met up with him. we was being such a gentleman bowing and
holding his hands out to invite us in through doors, it was so funny and 이모 didn't seem used to it at all haha 
When we got there, there was already a queue, and we were num 12, so we had to wait a bit. there was a cha eun woo 
cut out in front of the store tho so all was good. 
when we eventually got it, the food was so freaking good. we got a whole basket of galbi, and so much freaking bangchan:
radish kimchi (2 types, round sweet, and spicy thin), raw marinated crab (icy, but pretty good!), and bean sprouts
The meat was so scrumptious, we made a bunch of wraps with lettuce, cabbage, perilla, and other leaves. the samjang 
was also bussin. we also got kimchi jjigae, probably the best kimchi jjigae ive ever had, the pork was so freaking 
tender; i definitely had to go bacl. poor sophie, she could only eat the naengmyeon, and 이모 kept making her eat the 
kimchi from the jjigae. We ended the meal sharing a bowl of naengmyeon, and that was also so good, with ice and really
nice thin (buckwheat?) noodles. i ate so freaking much, i was so full, it was so unlike yesterday with so little for 
dinner lol. they also changed out the galbi cookin plate so many times, even while we were still cooking the first round,which was really nice of her. 
There were also a bunch of toad statues all over the store, which was so cute hehe. we ended up walking back to seongsu
and it was so freaking close hehe, it was good to walk off the food. we got home and still had room for ice cream,
so sophie and i had the mango one, and it was delicious. lovely end to the night. i also had to wash my underwear today
so my back hurts, oof.
