<pre>
	- breach of confidentiality
	- breach of availability
	- breach of integrity
	- theft of service
	- denial of service 
	
	Method of Security Violation 
		1. masquerading
		2. replay attack (message mods)
		3. man in the middle (intruder in data flow)
		4. sesison hijaking
		5. privilege escalation 
	
	Security Measure Levels 
		1. physical
		2. app
		3. OS
		4. network 
			- really big in IT today
	
	- security as weak as weakest link in chain
	- humans also rsk b/c of phishing + social engineering

<span id="Chapter 16: Security-Program Threats"></span><strong id="Program Threats">Program Threats</strong>
</p>
<pre>
	1. malware = software designed to exploit/damage computer
	2. trojan horse = program that acts in clandestine manner 
			- spyware = program installed w/ legit software to capture data
			- ransomware = lock up dat w/ encryption, demand payment

<pre>
	- 90s: buffer + padding + code can be overwritten + flow into ur program area + puts new instructions into mem 
	- start running malicious instructions (got a lot of microsoft products

Test 3 Answers:
 4k page size, displacement = 11-31 bits
Solution:
	4k = 2^12 = 12 displacement, but 11-31 is 11 bits displacement
	therefore not possible
 
 
 Can have virus in computer boot sector
 
 System and Network Threats
 	- worms = use spawning
	- port scanning 
	- denial of service 
	  	- overload 1 server 

Cryptography as a security tool 
	1. encryption = use key value pairs

e.g. XOR:
1 + 1 = 0
0 + 0 = 0
1 + 0 = 1
0 + 1 = 1

Art 
A = 41 
r = 72
t = 74
*Convert to binary

Let key = ArtArt (all in binary)
	- use XOR value for each bit = get encrypted info 
	- use same key ArtArt to decrypt it and get og binary for ArtArt

RSA algo
	1. generate key
	2. distribute public key to encrypter ppl 
	3. they encrypt message and give it to you
	4. you use your private key to decrypt it

- many encryption algos take a lot of time, so are tradeoffs 
  
*Authentication
	- Use hash functions (MD5, SHA-1) 
	- digital signatures 
	  - use a lot for legal things (docusign) 
		 
Firewalls for protection + VPNs good 
	- proxy firewall 

1 M segment size + 4k Page size
BITS: 0-11 segment index
BITS: 12-20 are page index
BITS: 21-31 are byte index

Solution: 4k page size = 2^12, 12 bits displacement
			 21-31 = 11 bits != 12 bits, so NOT possible
