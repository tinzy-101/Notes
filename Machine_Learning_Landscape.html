	- important landmarks:
			  - supervised vs unsupervised learning
			  - online vs batch learning
			  - instance-based vs model-based learning
	- ml = programming computers so they can learn from data 
	  - e.g. spam filter for emails; spam filter is "trained" using examples of spam vs nonspam emails
	  - training set = examples that system learns from
	  - training instance / sample = each training example
	  - accuracy = performance measure w/ ratio of correctly classified emails
	  - e.g. downloading some document w/ info is NOT ml
	- ML techniques are accurate, shorter, and easier to maintain + automatically update itself 
	  - also good for speech recognition
	  - also good to help humans learn (data mining, notice patterns thru AI)
	 
	Examples of ML:
		1. find tumors in brain scan
		2. automatically classifying news articles (natural language processing)
		3. automatically flag offensive commetns
		4. summarize long docs
		5. create chatbot
		6. forecasting next year's revenue based on performance metrics 
			- regression task = predicting
			- use a regression model (linear or polynomial)
		7. app react to voice command
			- need to process audio samples using RNNs, CNNs 
		8. detect credit card fraud (anomaly detection)
		9. segment clients based on purchases (clustering)
		10. represent complex, n-dimensional dataset in clear diagram 
			 - need dimensionality reduction techniques 
		11. recommend product based on past purchases 
			 
	Types of ML Systems:
		1. trained w/ human supervision or not 
			- supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised, reinforcement learning
		2. can learn incremently on the fly or not 
			- online vs batch learning 
		3. does it work by comparing new data to known data points, or actually detect patterns in training data and build predictive model? 
			- instance-based vs model-based learning 
		--&gt; can combine all the criteria together
