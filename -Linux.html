using xkb:
	1. xkb = x keyboard extension, can be configured to use multiple keyboard layouts
	2. go to /usr/share/X11/xkb to see all directories
		a. base.lst in rules directory has all the possible configurations (langugages supported)
		b. to configure new language, need to go to /usr/share/locale
	3. go to symbols directory to see names of different symbols for each supported language 
	4. go to evdev file in keycodes directory to see the keycodes associated with each key on keyboard (can also run xev in terminal to find keycodes and associated hex)
	5. use setxkbmap to change configurations
		a. general format (in terminal or in wm config file): 
				setxkbmap [-model xkb_model] [-layout xkb_layout] [-variant xkb_variant] [-option xkb_options]
				-supported layouts, variants, and options in base.lst
			sample format:
				setxkbmap -model pc104 -layout cz,us -variant ,dvorak -option grp:win_space_toggle
		b. sample format: sets keyboard format to czech and us, no variant on czech keyboard but us isin the dvorak layout, and you can toggle different keyboard layouts using window + space 
	6. setxkbmap -print -verbose 10 (in terminal)
		a. prints current xkbmap settings 

compose keys:
	1. can set a &lt;Multi_key&gt; that when pressed + two more keys will print special character
	2. go to /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8 (if using en_US.UTF-8) as your locale
	3. Compose file shows preconfigured compose key combos
	4. to configure your own combos: create ~/.XCompose file
		a.	include "%L"
			&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;g&gt; &lt;a&gt; : "α"
			&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;g&gt; &lt;b&gt; : "β"
			&lt;Multi_key&gt; &lt;g&gt; &lt;g&gt; : "γ" 
		b. include "%L" includes current Compose file
		c. press multikey + g + a = get alpha character
	5. configuring multikey
		a. go to ~/.Xmodmap
		b. keycode 66 = Multi_key
			clear lock
			-find keycode for desired key on your keyboard using xim (66 = caps)
			-idk what clear lock does, but it works
		c. xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap to reload and set new multikey
		d. use &lt;xmodmap -pk | grep Multi_key&gt; to see which keys you've configured as multi
		e. CANNOT remove multikeys just by deleting fom xmodmap file, need to manually reconfigure
			-e.g. get caps back: keycode 66 = Caps_Lock (check names in xkb rules)
			-or else will end up with TWO multikeys
	6. getting gtk to recognize compose keys (XIM is NOT supported by default)
		a. go to /etc/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
		b. add &lt;GTK_IM_MODULE=xim&gt; and &lt;XMODIFIERS="@im=none"&gt;
		

custom keybindings guide:
	1. keys (e.g. &lt;AD01&gt;)
		-A = alphanumeric (KP = keypad, FN = function)
		-D = the row (A = keyboard row, count up to 4th row of alphanumeric block is D)
		-01 = the column (left to right, ignoring special keys like tab/caps)
